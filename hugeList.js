#################################################
###Block: A
# Spell Name	Type	Description
Acid Arrow.MOD	DESC:An arrow of acid springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The arrow deals 2d4 points of acid damage with no splash damage. For every three caster levels you possess, the acid, unless neutralized, lasts for another round [to a maximum of 6 additional rounds at 18th level], dealing another 2d4 points of damage in each round.
Acid Fog.MOD	DESC:Acid fog creates a billowing mass of misty vapors like the solid fog spell. In addition to slowing down creatures and obscuring sight, this spell's vapors are highly acidic. Each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to each creature and object within it.
Acid Splash.MOD	DESC:You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage. This acid disappears after 1 round.
Aid.MOD	DESC:Aid grants the target a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + caster level [to a maximum of 1d8+10 temporary hit points at caster level 10th].
Air Walk.MOD	DESC:The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to half the air walker's normal speed. A strong wind [21+ miles per hour] can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of a creature's turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field. You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of air walk [counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill] with 1 week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.
Alarm.MOD	DESC:Alarm creates a subtle ward on an area you select. Once the spell effect is in place, it thereafter sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password [determined by you at the time of casting] does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible in nature. Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts you [and only you] so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental "ping" that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm. Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing. Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm. Alarm can be made permanent with a permanency spell.  
Align Weapon.MOD	DESC:Align weapon makes a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, as you choose. A weapon that is aligned can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. This spell has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. When you make a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, align weapon is a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful spell, respectively.
Alter Self.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any Small or Medium creature of the humanoid type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, and swim 30 feet. Small creature: If the form you take is that of a Small humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Dexterity. Medium creature: If the form you take is that of a Medium humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength.
Analyze Dweomer.MOD	DESC:You can observe magical auras. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can see as a free action. In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions [including any curse effects], how to activate its functions [if appropriate], and how many charges are left [if it uses charges]. In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level. An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other analyze dweomer spells for 24 hours. Analyze dweomer does not function when used on an artifact.
Animal Growth.MOD	DESC:The target animal grows to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. This alteration changes the animal's size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution [and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD], and imposes a -2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC, attack rolls, and its base damage. The animal's space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does not change. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check [using its increased Strength] to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it-the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by the animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size. The spell gives no means of command over an enlarged animal. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.
Animal Messenger.MOD	DESC:You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions. Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. You can attach a small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities. During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message [if it's written in a language he doesn't know, for example].
Animal Shapes.MOD	DESC:As beast shape III, except you change the form of up to one willing creature per caster level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures. All creatures must take the same kind of animal form. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone.
Animal Trance.MOD	DESC:Your swaying motions and music [or singing, or chanting] compel animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can be fascinated by this spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected.
Animate Dead.MOD	DESC:This spell turns corpses into undead skeletons or zombies that obey your spoken commands. The undead can be made to follow you, or they can be made to remain in an area and attack any creature [or just a specific kind of creature] entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again. Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of animate dead. The desecrate spell doubles this limit. The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Undead you control through the Command Undead feat do not count toward this limit. Skeletons: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. Zombies: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a physical anatomy.
Animate Objects.MOD	DESC:You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate. An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or a corresponding number of larger objects as follows: A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. This spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature. Animate objects can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Animate Plants.MOD	DESC:You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life. Each animated plant then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate as though it were an animated object of the appropriate size category. You may animate one Large or smaller plant, or a number of larger plants as follows: a Huge plant counts as two Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant as four, and a Colossal plant as eight. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. Use the statistics for animated objects, except that plants smaller than Large don't have hardness. Animate plants cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material. Entangle: Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range with a degree of mobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area. This usage of the spell duplicates the effect of an entangle spell. Spell resistance does not keep creatures from being entangled. This effect lasts 1 hour per caster level.
Animate Rope.MOD	DESC:You can animate a nonliving rope-like object. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50%% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50%% for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half. The possible commands are "coil" [form a neat, coiled stack], "coil and knot," "loop," "loop and knot," "tie and knot," and the opposites of all of the above ["uncoil," and so forth]. You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell. The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it-it does not snake outward-so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll [range increment 10 feet]. A typical 1-inch-diameter hemp rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check. The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical. The spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.
Antilife Shell.MOD	DESC:You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents the entrance of most types of living creatures. The effect hedges out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, and vermin, but not constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead. This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.
Antimagic Field.MOD	DESC:An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines. An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check [1d20 + caster level] against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. [The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.] A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword [and a masterwork sword at that]. The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting [unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures]. Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field. Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.
Antipathy.MOD	DESC:You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named. Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points. Antipathy counters and dispels sympathy.
Antiplant Shell.MOD	DESC:The antiplant shell spell creates an invisible, mobile barrier that keeps all creatures within the shell protected from attacks by plant creatures or animated plants. As with many abjuration spells, forcing the barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay strains and collapses the field.
Arcane Eye.MOD	DESC:You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the arcane eye at any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round [300 feet per minute] if viewing an area ahead as a human would [primarily looking at the floor] or 10 feet per round [100 feet per minute] if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there. The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a gate or similar magical portal. You must concentrate to use an arcane eye. If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate.
Arcane Lock.MOD	DESC:An arcane lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You can freely pass your own arcane lock without affecting it. If the locked object has a lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 10 while it remains attached to the object. If the object does not have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with a DC 20 Disable Device skill check. A door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful dispel magic or knock spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. A knock spell does not remove an arcane lock; it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.
Arcane Mark.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable. See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell. If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month. Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting instant summons on the same object [see that spell description for details].
Arcane Sight.MOD	DESC:This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. [Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.] If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine [spell-like abilities register as arcane], and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use. As with detect magic, you can use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but not artifacts. Arcane sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Arcane Sight (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like arcane sight, except that you automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see. Unlike arcane sight, this spell cannot be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Astral Projection.MOD	DESC:By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether. You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them. You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body [and equipment] on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter. While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane [which kills you]. When this spell ends, your astral body and all of its gear, vanishes.
Atonement.MOD	DESC:This spell removes the burden of misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must intercede with your deity [requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings]. Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected. Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost. Restore Class: A paladin, or other class, who has lost her class features due to violating the alignment restrictions of her class may have her class features restored by this spell. Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god's intercession. Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally. Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question. Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement offers a method for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.
Augury.MOD	DESC:An augury can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%% + 1%% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results: . Weal [if the action will probably bring good results]. . Woe [for bad results]. . Weal and woe [for both]. . Nothing [for actions that don't have especially good or bad results]. If the spell fails, you get the "nothing" result. A cleric who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury. The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the longterm consequences of a contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person about the same topic use the same die result as the first casting.
Awaken.MOD	DESC:You awaken a tree or animal to human-like sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save [DC 10 + the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened]. The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. If you cast awaken again, any previously awakened creatures remain friendly to you, but they no longer undertake tasks for you unless it is in their best interests. An awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An awakened plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's. An awakened animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast [augmented animal]. An awakened animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount. An awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus [if any]. This spell does not function on an animal or plant with an Intelligence greater than 2.
#Block: B
Baleful Polymorph.MOD	DESC:As beast shape III, except that you change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast spells [if it had the ability], and gains the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its class and level [or HD], as well as all benefits deriving therefrom [such as base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points]. It retains any class features [other than spellcasting] that aren't extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities. Any polymorph effects on the target are automatically dispelled when a target fails to resist the effects of baleful polymorph, and as long as baleful polymorph remains in effect, the target cannot use other polymorph spells or effects to assume a new form. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.
Bane.MOD	DESC:Bane fills your enemies with fear and doubt. Each affected creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and a -1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Bane counters and dispels bless.
Banishment.MOD	DESC:A banishment spell is a more powerful version of the dismissal spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished. You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance [if any], and the saving throw DC increases by 2. Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses [each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by 4].
Barkskin.MOD	DESC:Barkskin toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level. The enhancement bonus provided by barkskin stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.
Bear's Endurance.MOD	DESC:The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.
Bear's Endurance (Mass).MOD	DESC:Mass bear's endurance works like bear's endurance, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Beast Shape I.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any Small or Medium creature of the animal type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: climb 30 feet, fly 30 feet [average maneuverability], swim 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, and scent. Small animal: If the form you take is that of a Small animal, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Dexterity and a +1 natural armor bonus. Medium animal: If the form you take is that of a Medium animal, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength and a +2 natural armor bonus.
Beast Shape II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as beast shape I, except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Tiny or Large creature of the animal type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet [good maneuverability], swim 60 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, grab, pounce, and trip. Tiny animal: If the form you take is that of a Tiny animal, you gain a +4 size bonus to your Dexterity, a -2 penalty to your Strength, and a +1 natural armor bonus. Large animal: If the form you take is that of a Large animal, you gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a -2 penalty to your Dexterity, and a +4 natural armor bonus.
Beast Shape III.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as beast shape II, except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Diminutive or Huge creature of the animal type. This spell also allows you to take on the form of a Small or Medium creature of the magical beast type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: burrow 30 feet, climb 90 feet, fly 90 feet [good maneuverability], swim 90 feet, blindsense 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, constrict, ferocity, grab, jet, poison, pounce, rake, trample, trip, and web. Diminutive animal: If the form you take is that of a Diminutive animal, you gain a +6 size bonus to your Dexterity, a -4 penalty to your Strength, and a +1 natural armor bonus. Huge animal: If the form you take is that of a Huge animal, you gain a +6 size bonus to your Strength, a -4 penalty to your Dexterity, and a +6 natural armor bonus. Small magical beast: If the form you take is that of a Small magical beast, you gain a +4 size bonus to your Dexterity, and a +2 natural armor bonus. Medium magical beast: If the form you take is that of a Medium magical beast, you gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength, and a +4 natural armor bonus.
Beast Shape IV.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as beast shape III except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Tiny or Large creature of the magical beast type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: burrow 60 feet, climb 90 feet, fly 120 feet [good maneuverability], swim 120 feet, blindsense 60 feet, darkvision 90 feet, low-light vision, scent, tremorsense 60 feet, breath weapon, constrict, ferocity, grab, jet, poison, pounce, rake, rend, roar, spikes, trample, trip, and web. If the creature has immunity or resistance to any elements, you gain resistance 20 to those elements. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability. Tiny magical beast: If the form you take is that of a Tiny magical beast, you gain a -2 penalty to your Strength, a +8 size bonus to your Dexterity, and a +3 natural armor bonus. Large magical beast: If the form you take is that of a Large magical beast, you gain a +6 size bonus to your Strength, a - 2 penalty on your Dexterity, a +2 size bonus to your Constitution, and a +6 natural armor bonus.
Bestow Curse.MOD	DESC:You place a curse on the subject. Choose one of the following. . -6 decrease to an ability score [minimum 1]. . -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. . Each turn, the target has a 50%% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action. You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Bestow curse counters remove curse.
Binding.MOD	DESC:A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level. You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible. Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC [assuming a saving throw is allowed] by 2. If you cast any of the first three versions of binding [those with limited durations], you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all binding spells it has received are broken. The binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell. Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times. Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect. Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect. Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast. Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or mage's disjunction affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect.
Black Tentacles.MOD	DESC:This spell causes a field of rubbery black tentacles to appear, burrowing up from the floor and reaching for any creature in the area. Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning of your turn, including the round that black tentacles is cast. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the tentacles' CMB, the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their Strength and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect. If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The black tentacles spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that black tentacles succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The CMD of black tentacles, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB. The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last.
Blade Barrier.MOD	DESC:An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 15d6], with a Reflex save for half damage. If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall [ending up on the side of its choice] and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save. A blade barrier provides cover [+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves] against attacks made through it.
Blasphemy.MOD	DESC:Any nonevil creature within the area of a blasphemy spell suffers the following ill effects. &nl;HD &pipe; Effect &nl;Equal to caster level &pipe; Dazed &nl;Up to caster level -1 &pipe; Weakened, dazed &nl;Up to caster level -5 &pipe; Paralyzed, weakened, dazed &nl;Up to caster level -10 &pipe; Killed, paralyzed, weakened, dazed &nl;The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects. Dazed: The creature can take no actions for 1 round, though it defends itself normally. Save negates. Weakened: The creature's Strength score decreases by 2d6 points for 2d4 rounds. Save for half. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. Save reduces the paralyzed effect to 1 round. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +25]. Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the blasphemy or not. The banishment effect allows a Will save [at a -4 penalty] to negate. Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by blasphemy.
Bleed.MOD	DESC:You cause a living creature that is below 0 hit points but stabilized to resume dying. Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has -1 or fewer hit points. That creature begins dying, taking 1 point of damage per round. The creature can be stabilized later normally. This spell causes a creature that is dying to take 1 point of damage.
Bless.MOD	DESC:Bless fills your allies with courage. Each ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects. Bless counters and dispels bane.
Bless Water.MOD	DESC:This transmutation imbues a flask [1 pint] of water with positive energy, turning it into holy water.
Bless Weapon.MOD	DESC:This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the DR of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures [though the spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus]. The weapon also becomes good-aligned, which means it can bypass the DR of certain creatures. [This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have.] Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons [such as bows] don't confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot. In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits, such as a keen weapon or a vorpal sword.
Blight.MOD	DESC:This spell withers a single plant of any size. An affected plant creature takes 1d6 points of damage per level [maximum 15d6] and may attempt a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. A plant that isn't a creature doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies. This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.
Blindness/Deafness.MOD	DESC:You call upon the powers of unlife to render the subject blinded or deafened, as you choose.
Blink.MOD	DESC:You "blink" quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane and look as though you're winking in and out of reality at random. Blink has several effects, as follows. Physical attacks against you have a 50%% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20%% [for concealment]. If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%%. [For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.] Likewise, your own attacks have a 20%% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike. Any individually targeted spell has a 50%% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20%% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane [but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane]. While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks [but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane]. Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material. While blinking, you can step through [but not see through] solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50%% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.
Blur.MOD	DESC:The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting, and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment [20%% miss chance]. A see invisibility spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a true seeing spell does. Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect [though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own].
Break Enchantment.MOD	DESC:This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check [1d20 + caster level, maximum +15] against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse. If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects.
Breath of Life.MOD	DESC:This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +25]. Unlike other spells that heal damage, breath of life can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through breath of life gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day. Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by breath of life. Like cure spells, breath of life deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.
Bull's Strength.MOD	DESC:The subject becomes stronger. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier.
Bull's Strength (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like bull's strength, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Burning Hands.MOD	DESC:A cone of searing flame shoots from your fingertips. Any creature in the area of the flames takes 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level [maximum 5d4]. Flammable materials burn if the flames touch them. A character can extinguish burning items as a full-round action.

#Block: C
Call Lightning.MOD	DESC:Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-footlong, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a spell's range [measured from your position at the time]. Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected. You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the first you may use a standard action [concentrating on the spell] to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level [maximum 10 bolts]. If you are outdoors and in a stormy area-a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado [including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size]-each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6. This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.
Call Lightning Storm.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like call lightning, except that each bolt deals 5d6 points of electricity damage [or 5d10 if created outdoors in a stormy area], and you may call a maximum of 15 bolts.
Calm Animals.MOD	DESC:This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless. Only ordinary animals [those with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2] can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of HD of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level. The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.
Calm Emotions.MOD	DESC:This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm emotions can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions [although they can defend themselves] or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures. This spell automatically suppresses [but does not dispel] any morale bonuses granted by spells such as bless, good hope, and rage, and also negates a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell, condition, or effect has no effect. When the calm emotions spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
Cat's Grace.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, adding the usual benefits to AC, Reflex saves, and other uses of the Dexterity modifier.
Cat's Grace (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like cat's grace, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Cause Fear.MOD	DESC:The affected creature becomes frightened. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is shaken for 1 round. Creatures with 6 or more HD are immune to this effect. Cause fear counters and dispels remove fear.
Chain Lightning.MOD	DESC:This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level [maximum 20d6] to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level [maximum 20]. The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt. Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.
Changestaff.MOD	DESC:You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treant-like creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The stafftreant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires [or when the spell is dismissed], and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.
Chaos Hammer.MOD	DESC:You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a multicolored explosion of leaping, ricocheting energy. Only lawful and neutral [not chaotic] creatures are harmed by the spell. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d8] to lawful creatures [or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders] and slows them for 1d6 rounds [see the slow spell]. A successful Will save reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect. The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again [down to one-quarter] with a successful Will save.
Charm Animal.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like charm person, except that it affects a creature of the animal type.
Charm Monster.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like charm person, except that the effect is not restricted by creature type or size.
Charm Monster (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like charm monster, except that mass charm monster affects a number of creatures whose combined HD do not exceed twice your level, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you must choose a creature with too many HD to affect.
Charm Person.MOD	DESC:This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally [treat the target's attitude as friendly]. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. [Retries are not allowed.] An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.
Chill Metal.MOD	DESC:Chill metal makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher. A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage [1 point or 2 points; see the table] if it's not wearing or wielding such an item. On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second [and also the next-to-last] round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, and causes more damage, as shown on the table below. &nl;Round &pipe; Metal Temperature &pipe; Damage &nl;1 &pipe; Cold &pipe; None &nl;2 &pipe; Icy &pipe; 1d4 points &nl;3-5 &pipe; Freezing &pipe; 2d4 points &nl;6 &pipe; Icy &pipe; 1d4 points &nl;7 &pipe; Cold &pipe; None &nl;Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell [and vice versa] on a point-for-point basis. Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it float if unattended. Chill metal counters and dispels heat metal.
Chill Touch.MOD	DESC:A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level. An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster level.
Circle of Death.MOD	DESC:Circle of death snuffs out the life force of living creatures, killing them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of living creatures per caster level [maximum 20d4]. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No creature of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.
Clairaudience/Clairvoyance.MOD	DESC:Clairaudience/clairvoyance creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see [your choice] almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known-a place familiar to you, or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect. Clairaudience/clairvoyance functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.
Clenched Fist.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like interposing hand, except that the hand can also push or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours. The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier [for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively] + 11 for the hand's Strength score [33], - 1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a Fortitude save [against this spell's save DC] or be stunned for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The clenched fist can also interpose itself as interposing hand does, or it can bull rush an opponent as forceful hand does. Its CMB for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +11 bonus for its Strength score and a +1 bonus for being Large.
Cloak of Chaos.MOD	DESC:A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become confused. This abjuration has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike protection from law, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures. Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures. Third, the abjuration protects from possession and mental influence, just as protection from law does. Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is confused for 1 round [Will save negates, as with the confusion spell, but against the save DC of cloak of chaos].
Clone.MOD	DESC:This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement [provided that the soul is free and willing to return]. The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span [that is, it has died of natural causes], any cloning attempt fails. To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh [not hair, nails, scales, or the like] with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months. When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical to the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including its gaining of two permanent negative levels, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead [if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be cloned]. If the original creature gained permanent negative levels since the flesh sample was taken, the clone gains these negative levels as well. The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh which rots if not preserved.
Cloudkill.MOD	DESC:This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud, except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD [no save]. A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save [in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud]. A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud [a successful Fortitude save halves this damage]. Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell. Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell. Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.
Color Spray.MOD	DESC:A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its HD. 2 HD or less: The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. [Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.] 3 or 4 HD: The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round. 5 or more HD: The creature is stunned for 1 round. Sightless creatures are not affected by color spray.
Command.MOD	DESC:You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options. Approach: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal. Drop: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn. Fall: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties. Flee: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal. Halt: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless. If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.
Command (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like command, except that up to one creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creature's action after the first, it gets another Will save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.
Command Plants.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more plant creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way [treat their attitude as friendly]. They will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. [Retries are not allowed.] A commanded plant never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. You can affect a number of plant creatures whose combined level or HD do not exceed twice your level.
Command Undead.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you a degree of control over an undead creature. If the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions favorably [treat its attitude as friendly]. It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. Retries are not allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "come here," "go there," "fight," "stand still," and so on. Nonintelligent undead won't resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead [regardless of its Intelligence] breaks the spell. Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.
Commune.MOD	DESC:You contact your deity-or agents thereof-and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. [A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.] You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. "Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase [five words or less] may be given as an answer instead. The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends.
Commune with Nature.MOD	DESC:You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting. In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings-caves, caverns, and the like-the spell is less powerful, and its radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.
Comprehend Languages.MOD	DESC:You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it. Written material can be read at the rate of one page [250 words] per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic [such as the secret page and illusory script spells]. It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text. Comprehend languages can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Cone of Cold.MOD	DESC:Cone of cold creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level [maximum 15d6].
Confusion.MOD	DESC:This spell causes confusion in the targets, making them unable to determine their actions. Roll on the following table at the start of each subject's turn each round to see what it does in that round. &nl;d%% &pipe; Behavior &nl;01-25 &pipe; Act normally &nl;26-50 &pipe; Do nothing but babble incoherently &nl;51-75 &pipe; Deal 1d8 points of damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand &nl;76-100 &pipe; Attack nearest creature [for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self] &nl;A confused character who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking [either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked].
Confusion (Lesser).MOD	DESC:This spell causes a single creature to become confused for 1 round.
Consecrate.MOD	DESC:This spell blesses an area with positive energy. The DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers minor disruption, suffering a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated area. If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled [+6 sacred bonus to positive channeled energy DCs, -2 penalties for undead in the area]. You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron. Instead, the consecrate spell curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above. Consecrate counters and dispels desecrate.
Contact Other Plane.MOD	DESC:You send your mind to another plane of existence [an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed] in order to receive advice and information from powers there. See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or some other one-word answer. You must concentrate on maintaining the spell [a standard action] in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question for every two caster levels. Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. [Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.] On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces. Avoid Int/Cha Decrease: You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. If a successful contact is made, roll d%% to determine the type of answer you gain. True Answer: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly. Don't Know: The entity tells you that it doesn't know. Lie: The entity intentionally lies to you. Random Answer: The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the answer, so it makes one up.
Contagion.MOD	DESC:The subject contracts one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom. The disease is contracted immediately [the onset period does not apply]. Use the disease's listed frequency and save DC to determine further effects. For more information see Diseases.
Contingency.MOD	DESC:You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting contingency. The contingency spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast contingency. The spell to be brought into effect by the contingency must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level [rounded down, maximum 6th level]. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being "cast" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination [contingency and the companion magic] may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to. You can use only one contingency spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one [if still active] is dispelled.
Continual Flame.MOD	DESC:A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched. Light spells counter and dispel darkness spells of an equal or lower level.
Control Plants.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible, the controlled plants do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior. Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.
Control Undead.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you to control undead creatures for a short period of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible, the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior. Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them, and they may seek revenge after the spell's effects end.
Control Water.MOD	DESC:This spell has two different applications, both of which control water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water's depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas. Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level [to a minimum depth of 1 inch]. The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level ? 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other waterbased creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell [Will negates]. The spell has no effect on other creatures. Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land. With either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to change the overall area of effect.
Control Weather.MOD	DESC:You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. You can also use this spell to cause the weather in the area to become calm and normal for the season. &nl;Season &pipe; Possible Weather &nl;Spring &pipe; Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather &nl;Summer &pipe; Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm &nl;Autumn &pipe; Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet &nl;Winter &pipe; Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw &nl;Late winter &pipe; Hurricane-force winds or early spring &nl;You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather-where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather [which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later]. Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously. Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena [naturally occurring or otherwise] as well as create them. A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a circle with a 3-mile radius.
Control Winds.MOD	DESC:You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an "eye" of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full limit. Wind Direction: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area. . A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions. . An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center. . Rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion. . A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other. Wind Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area. See Environment for more details. Strong winds [21+ mph] make sailing difficult. A severe wind [31+ mph] causes minor ship and building damage. A windstorm [51+ mph] drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships. Hurricane force winds [75+ mph] destroy wooden buildings, uproot large trees, and cause most ships to founder. A tornado [175+ mph] destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees.
Create Food and Water.MOD	DESC:The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choice -highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible after 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a purify food and water spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water, and it doesn't go bad as the food does.
Create Greater Undead.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like create undead, except that you can create more powerful and intelligent sorts of undead: shadows, wraiths, spectres, and devourers. The type or types of undead created is based on caster level, as shown below. &nl;Caster Level &pipe; Undead Created &nl;15th or lower &pipe; Shadow &nl;16th-17th &pipe; Wraith &nl;18th-19th &pipe; Spectre &nl;20th or higher &pipe; Devourer
Create Undead.MOD	DESC:A much more potent spell than animate dead, this evil spell allows you to infuse a dead body with negative energy to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs. The type or types of undead you can create are based on your caster level, as shown on the table below. &nl;Caster Level &pipe; Undead Created &nl;11th or lower &pipe; Ghoul &nl;12th-14th &pipe; Ghast &nl;15th-17th &pipe; Mummy &nl;18th or higher &pipe; Mohrg &nl;You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms. This spell must be cast at night.
Create Water.MOD	DESC:This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large-possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles. This water disappears after 1 day if not consumed. Note: Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.
Creeping Doom.MOD	DESC:This spell summons four massive swarms of biting and stinging insects. These swarms appear adjacent to one another, but can be directed to move independently. Treat these swarms as centipede swarms with the following adjustments. The swarms have 60 hit points each and deal 4d6 points of damage with their swarm attack. The save to resist their poison and distraction effects is equal to the save DC of this spell. Creatures caught in multiple swarms only take damage and make saves once. You may summon the swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. As a standard action, you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any target within 100 feet of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area [but can be commanded again if you move within 100 feet].
Crushing Despair.MOD	DESC:An invisible cone of despair causes great sadness in the subjects. Each affected creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Crushing despair counters and dispels good hope.
Crushing Hand.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as interposing hand, except that it can also grapple one opponent as grasping hand. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score [35] and a +1 bonus for being Large [its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD]. A crushing hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The crushing hand can instead be directed to bull rush a target [as forceful hand], using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as interposing hand does.
Cure Critical Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like cure light wounds, except that it cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +20].
Cure Critical Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass cure light wounds, except that it cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +40].
Cure Light Wounds.MOD	DESC:When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +5]. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.
Cure Light Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:You channel positive energy to cure 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +25] on each selected creature. Like other cure spells, mass cure light wounds deals damage to undead in its area rather than curing them. Each affected undead may attempt a Will save for half damage.
Cure Moderate Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like cure light wounds, except that it cures 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +10].
Cure Moderate Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass cure light wounds, except that it cures 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +30].
Cure Serious Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like cure light wounds, except that it cures 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +15].
Cure Serious Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass cure light wounds, except that it cures 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +35].
Curse Water.MOD	DESC:This spell imbues a flask [1 pint] of water with negative energy, turning it into unholy water [see Equipment]. Unholy water damages good outsiders the way holy water damages undead and evil outsiders.

#Block: D
Dancing Lights.MOD	DESC:Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches [and cast that amount of light], or up to four glowing spheres of light [which look like will-o'-wisps], or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire [no concentration required]: forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range. You can only have one dancing lights spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent, it does not count against this limit. Dancing lights can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Darkness.MOD	DESC:This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20- foot radius. This darkness causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to darkness. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment [20%% miss chance] in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment [50%% miss chance] in darkness. Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of darkness. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than darkness. If darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed. This spell does not stack with itself. Darkness can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.
Darkvision.MOD	DESC:The subject gains the ability to see 60 feet even in total darkness. Darkvision is black and white only but otherwise like normal sight. Darkvision can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Daylight.MOD	DESC:You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object to shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the light level for an additional 60 feet by one step [darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light]. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light. If daylight is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Daylight brought into an area of magical darkness [or vice versa] is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Daylight counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as darkness.
Daze.MOD	DESC:This spell clouds the mind of a humanoid creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice so that it takes no actions. Humanoids of 5 or more HD are not affected. A dazed subject is not stunned, so attackers get no special advantage against it. After a creature has been dazed by this spell, it is immune to the effects of this spell for 1 minute.
Daze Monster.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like daze, but it can affect any one living creature of any type. Creatures of 7 or more HD are not affected.
Death Knell.MOD	DESC:You draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature and use it to fuel your own power. Upon casting this spell, you touch a living creature that has -1 or fewer hit points. If the subject fails its saving throw, it dies, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on caster level. This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells. These effects last for 10 minutes per HD of the subject creature.
Death Ward.MOD	DESC:The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death spells and magical death effects. The subject is granted a save to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. The subject is immune to energy drain and any negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy. This spell does not remove negative levels that the subject has already gained, but it does remove the penalties from negative levels for the duration of its effect. Death ward does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.
Deathwatch.MOD	DESC:Using the powers of necromancy, you can determine the condition of creatures near death within the spell's range. You instantly know whether each creature within the area is dead, fragile [alive and wounded, with 3 or fewer hit points left], fighting off death [alive with 4 or more hit points], healthy, undead, or neither alive nor dead [such as a construct]. Deathwatch sees through any spell or ability that allows creatures to feign death.
Deep Slumber.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like sleep, except that it affects 10 HD of targets.
Deeper Darkness.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as darkness, except that objects radiate darkness in a 60-foot radius and the light level is lowered by two steps. Bright light becomes dim light and normal light becomes darkness. Areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark. This functions like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision cannot see within the spell's confines. This spell does not stack with itself. Deeper darkness can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.
Delay Poison.MOD	DESC:The subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's duration has expired. Delay poison does not cure any damage that poison may have already done.
Delayed Blast Fireball.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like fireball, except that it is more powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. The burst of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level [maximum 20d6]. The glowing bead created by delayed blast fireball can detonate immediately if you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. You select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and that time cannot change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead. If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon [range increment 10 feet]. If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25%% chance that the bead detonates while being handled.
Demand.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like sending, but the message can also contain a suggestion [see the suggestion spell], which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful Will save negates the suggestion effect but not the contact itself. The demand, if received, is understood even if the subject's Intelligence score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand is issued, the message is understood but the suggestion is ineffective. The demand's message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the suggestion. The creature can also give a short reply immediately.
Desecrate.MOD	DESC:This spell imbues an area with negative energy. The DC to resist negative channeled energy within this area gains a +3 profane bonus. Every undead creature entering a desecrated area gains a +1 profane bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. An undead creature created within or summoned into such an area gains +1 hit points per HD. If the desecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled [+6 profane bonus to negative channeled energy DCs, +2 profane bonus and +2 hit points per HD for undead created in the area]. Furthermore, anyone who casts animate dead within this area may create as many as double the normal amount of undead [that is, 4 HD per caster level rather than 2 HD per caster level]. If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the desecrate spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above. Desecrate counters and dispels consecrate.
Destruction.MOD	DESC:This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster level. If the spell slays the target, it consumes the remains utterly in holy [or unholy] fire [but not its equipment or possessions]. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 10d6 points of damage. The only way to restore life to a character who has failed to save against this spell [and was slain] is to use true resurrection, a carefully worded wish spell followed by resurrection, or miracle.
Detect Animals or Plants.MOD	DESC:You can detect a particular kind of animal or plant in a cone emanating out from you in whatever direction you face. You must think of a kind of animal or plant when using the spell, but you can change the animal or plant kind each round. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area or focus on a specific kind of animal or plant. 1st Round: Presence or absence of that kind of animal or plant in the area. 2nd Round: Number of individuals of the specified kind in the area and the condition of the healthiest specimen. 3rd Round: The condition [see below] and location of each individual present. If an animal or a plant is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Conditions: For purposes of this spell, the categories of condition are as follows: Normal: Has at least 90%% of full normal hit points, free of disease. Fair: 30%% to 90%% of full normal hit points remaining. Poor: Less than 30%% of full normal hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating injury. Weak: 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease that has reduced an ability score to 5 or less, or crippled. If a creature falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the weaker of the two. Each round you can turn to detect a kind of animal or plant in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. [Chart omitted]
Detect Chaos.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like detect evil, except that it detects the auras of chaotic creatures, clerics of chaotic deities, chaotic spells, and chaotic magic items, and you are vulnerable to an overwhelming chaotic aura if you are lawful.
Detect Evil.MOD	DESC:You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of evil. 2nd Round: Number of evil auras [creatures, objects, or spells] in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's power is overwhelming [see below], and the HD or level of the aura's source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. 3rd Round: The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Aura Power: An evil aura's power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or [in the case of a cleric] class level; see the table below. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two. Lingering Aura: An evil aura lingers after its original source dissipates [in the case of a spell] or is destroyed [in the case of a creature or magic item]. If detect evil is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim [even weaker than a faint aura]. How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: &nl;Original Strength &pipe; Duration of Lingering Aura &nl;Faint &pipe; 1d6 rounds &nl;Moderate &pipe; 1d6 minutes &nl;Strong &pipe; 1d6 x 10 minutes &nl;Overwhelming &pipe; 1d6 days &nl;Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them. Creatures with actively evil intents count as evil creatures for the purpose of this spell. Each round, you can turn to detect evil in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Detect Good.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like detect evil, except that it detects the auras of good creatures, clerics or paladins of good deities, good spells, and good magic items, and you are vulnerable to an overwhelming good aura if you are evil.
Detect Law.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like detect evil, except that it detects the auras of lawful creatures, clerics of lawful deities, lawful spells, and lawful magic items, and you are vulnerable to an overwhelming lawful aura if you are chaotic.
Detect Magic.MOD	DESC:You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras. 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge [arcana] skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect. If the aura eminates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties [see Spellcraft]. Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates [in the case of a spell] or is destroyed [in the case of a magic item]. If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim [even weaker than a faint aura]. How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: &nl;Original Strength &pipe; Duration of Lingering Aura &nl;Faint &pipe; 1d6 rounds &nl;Moderate &pipe; 1d6 minutes &nl;Strong &pipe; 1d6 x 10 minutes &nl;Overwhelming &pipe; 1d6 days &nl;Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Detect Poison.MOD	DESC:You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 Wisdom check. A character with the Craft [alchemy] skill may try a DC 20 Craft [alchemy] check if the Wisdom check fails, or may try the Craft [alchemy] check prior to the Wisdom check. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Detect Scrying.MOD	DESC:You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a divination [scrying] spell or effect. The spell's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell's area. If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks [1d20 + caster level]. If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his direction and distance from you.
Detect Secret Doors.MOD	DESC:You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of secret doors. 2nd Round: Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Each Additional Round: The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Detect Snares and Pits.MOD	DESC:You can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps. Detect snares and pits does detect certain natural hazards- quicksand [a snare], a sinkhole [a pit], or unsafe walls of natural rock [a deadfall]. It does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not detect magic traps [except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell snare], nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area. 1st Round: Presence or absence of hazards. 2nd Round: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Each Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to examine a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Detect Thoughts.MOD	DESC:You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of thoughts [from conscious creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or higher]. 2nd Round: Number of thinking minds and the Intelligence score of each. If the highest Intelligence is 26 or higher [and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score], you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can't see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting. 3rd Round: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast detect thoughts again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence [Int 1 or 2] have simple, instinctual thoughts. Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Detect Undead.MOD	DESC:You can detect the aura that surrounds undead creatures. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area. 1st Round: Presence or absence of undead auras. 2nd Round: Number of undead auras in the area and the strength of the strongest undead aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest undead aura's strength is overwhelming [see below], and the creature has HD of at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each undead aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Aura Strength: The strength of an undead aura is determined by the HD of the undead creature, as given on the table below. Lingering Aura: An undead aura lingers after its original source is destroyed. If detect undead is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim [even weaker than a faint aura]. How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power, as given on the table below. &nl;HD &pipe; Strength &pipe; Lingering Aura Duration &nl;1 or lower &pipe; Faint &pipe; 1d6 rounds &nl;2-4 &pipe; Moderate &pipe; 1d6 minutes &nl;5-10 &pipe; Strong &pipe; 1d6 x 10 minutes &nl;11 or higher &pipe; Overwhelming &pipe; 1d6 days &nl;Each round, you can turn to detect undead in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Dictum.MOD	DESC:Any nonlawful creature within the area of a dictum spell suffers the following ill effects. &nl;HD Effect &nl;Equal to caster level &pipe; Deafened &nl;Up to caster level -1 &pipe; Staggered, deafened &nl;Up to caster level -5 &pipe; Paralyzed, staggered, deafened &nl;Up to caster level -10 &pipe; Killed, paralyzed, staggered, deafened &nl;The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects. Deafened: The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds. Save negates. Staggered: The creature is staggered for 2d4 rounds. Save reduces the staggered effect to 1d4 rounds. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. Save reduces the paralyzed effect to 1 round. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +25]. Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonlawful extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the dictum or not. The banishment effect allows a Will save [at a -4 penalty] to negate. Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by dictum.
Dimension Door.MOD	DESC:You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired-whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature [carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load] or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.
Dimensional Anchor.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a dimensional anchor include astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spell-like abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a gate or teleportation circle for the duration of the spell. A dimensional anchor does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, dimensional anchor does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
Dimensional Lock.MOD	DESC:You create a shimmering emerald barrier that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred include astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spell-like abilities. Once dimensional lock is in place, extradimensional travel into or out of the area is not possible. A dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, the spell does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
Diminish Plants.MOD	DESC:This spell has two versions. Prune Growth: This version of the spell causes normal vegetation within long range [400 feet + 40 feet per level] to shrink to about one-third normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed. This version of diminish plants automatically dispels any spells or effects that enhance plants, such as entangle, plant growth, and wall of thorns. At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quartercircle. You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected. Stunt Growth: This version of the spell targets all normal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to half normal. This spell has no effect on plant creatures.
Discern Lies.MOD	DESC:Each round, you concentrate on one target, who must be within range. You know if the target deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie by discerning disturbances in its aura caused by lying. The spell does not reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal evasions. Each round, you may concentrate on a different target.
Discern Location.MOD	DESC:A discern location spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a mind blank spell or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. Discern location circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object's location [place, name, business name, building name, or the like], community, county [or similar political division], country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies. To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once.
Disguise Self.MOD	DESC:You make yourself-including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment-look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your creature type [although you can appear as another subtype]. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person or gender. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile [touch] or audible [sound] properties of you or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.
Disintegrate.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level [to a maximum of 40d6]. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as forceful hand or a wall of force, but not magical effects such as a globe of invulnerability or an antimagic field. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated. Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.
Dismissal.MOD	DESC:This spell forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper plane if it fails a Will save. If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but there is a 20%% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own.
Dispel Chaos.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like dispel evil, except that you are surrounded by constant, blue lawful energy, and the spell affects chaotic creatures and spells rather than evil ones.
Dispel Evil.MOD	DESC:Shimmering, white holy energy surrounds you. This energy has three effects. First, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by evil creatures. Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature can negate the effects with a successful Will save [spell resistance applies]. This use discharges and ends the spell. Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. Spells that can't be dispelled by dispel magic also can't be dispelled by dispel evil. Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.
Dispel Good.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like dispel evil, except that you are surrounded by dark, wavering unholy energy, and the spell affects good creatures and spells rather than evil ones.
Dispel Law.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like dispel evil, except that you are surrounded by flickering, yellow chaotic energy, and the spell affects lawful creatures and spells rather than evil ones.
Dispel Magic.MOD	DESC:You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel [but not counter] spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check [1d20 + your caster level] and compare that to the spell with highest caster level [DC = 11 + the spell's caster level]. If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin [caster level 12th] and fly [caster level 6th]. The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin [which would have required a 23 or higher], but it is high enough to end the fly [which only required a 17]. Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area [such as a wall of fire]. You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell [such as a monster summoned by summon monster], you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level [DC = 11 + the item's caster level]. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening [such as a bag of holding] is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword [a masterwork sword, in fact]. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.
Dispel Magic (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like dispel magic, except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures. You choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: This functions as a targeted dispel magic, but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC. Area Dispel: When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel magic. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel. For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area. If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell [such as a monster summoned by summon monster] is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature [returning it whence it came] in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object. You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast. Counterspell: This functions as dispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.
Displacement.MOD	DESC:The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50%% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals its true location and negates the miss chance.
Disrupt Undead.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:You direct a ray of positive energy. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if the ray hits an undead creature, it deals 1d6 points of damage to it.
Disrupting Weapon.MOD	DESC:This spell makes a melee weapon deadly to undead. Any undead creature with HD equal to or less than your caster level must succeed on a Will save or be destroyed utterly if struck in combat with this weapon. Spell resistance does not apply against the destruction effect.
Divination.MOD	DESC:Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 70%% + 1%% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work. As with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time.
Divine Favor.MOD	DESC:Calling upon the strength and wisdom of a deity, you gain a +1 luck bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls for every three caster levels you have [at least +1, maximum +3]. The bonus doesn't apply to spell damage.
Divine Power.MOD	DESC:Calling upon the divine power of your patron, you imbue yourself with strength and skill in combat. You gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, Strength checks, and Strength-based skill checks for every three caster levels you have [maximum +6]. You also gain 1 temporary hit point per caster level. Whenever you make a full-attack action, you can make an additional attack at your full base attack bonus, plus any appropriate modifiers. This additional attack is not cumulative with similar effects, such as haste or weapons with the speed special ability.
Dominate Animal.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to enchant the targeted animal and direct it with simple commands such as "Attack," "Run," and "Fetch." Suicidal or self-destructive commands [including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger than the dominated animal] are simply ignored. Dominate animal establishes a mental link between you and the subject creature. The animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the creature to control it. You do not receive direct sensory input from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing. Because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own comprehension. You need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn't do. Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
Dominate Monster.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like dominate person, except that the spell is not restricted by creature type.
Dominate Person.MOD	DESC:You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind. If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival [such as sleeping, eating, and so forth]. Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 [rather than DC 25] can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect [see the Sense Motive skill description]. Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell [a standard action], you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on. Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination. Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect does not automatically dispel it.
Doom.MOD	DESC:This spell fills a single subject with a feeling of horrible dread that causes it to become shaken.
Dream.MOD	DESC:You, or a messenger you touch, send a message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message. If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up [ending the spell] or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell. Creatures who don't sleep or don't dream cannot be contacted by this spell. The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally [always failing any saving throw] while in the trance. 

#Block: E
Eagle's Splendor.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, adding the usual benefits to Charismabased skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers [and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma] affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Charisma, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase.
Eagle's Splendor (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like eagle's splendor, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Earthquake.MOD	DESC:When you cast earthquake, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check [DC 20 + spell level] or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast. Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in [Reflex DC 15 half] and pinning that creature beneath the rubble [see below]. An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble. Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage [Reflex DC 15 half] and is pinned beneath the rubble [see below]. Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25%% chance to fall into one [Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure]. The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air [see Environment for more details]. Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage [Reflex DC 15 half] and is pinned beneath the rubble [see below]. River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud. Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.
Elemental Body I.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of a Small air, earth, fire, or water elemental. The abilities you gain depend upon the type of elemental into which you change. Elemental abilities based on size, such as burn, vortex, and whirlwind, use the size of the elemental you transform into to determine their effect.

You also gain swim 60 feet, darkvision 60 feet, the ability to create a vortex, and the ability to breathe water.
Elemental Body II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as elemental body I, except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Medium air, earth, fire, or water elemental. The abilities you gain depend upon the elemental. Air elemental: As elemental body I except that you gain a +4 size bonus to your Dexterity and a +3 natural armor bonus. Earth elemental: As elemental body I except that you gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength and a +5 natural armor bonus. Fire elemental: As elemental body I except that you gain a +4 size bonus to your Dexterity and a +3 natural armor bonus.

Elemental Body III.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as elemental body II, except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Large air, earth, fire, or water elemental. The abilities you gain depend upon the type of elemental into which you change. You are also immune to critical hits and sneak attacks while in elemental form. Air elemental: As elemental body I except that you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength, +4 size bonus to your Dexterity, and a +4 natural armor bonus.

Elemental Body IV.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as elemental body III, except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Huge air, earth, fire, or water elemental. The abilities you gain depend upon the type of elemental into which you change. You are also immune to critical hits and sneak attacks while in elemental form and gain DR 5/-.

You also gain swim 120 feet.
Elemental Swarm.MOD	DESC:This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. A druid can choose any plane [Air, Earth, Fire, or Water]; a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain. When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum hit points per HD. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell. The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
Endure Elements.MOD	DESC:A creature protected by endure elements suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. The creature's equipment is likewise protected. Endure elements doesn't provide any protection from fire or cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth.
Energy Drain.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:This spell functions like enervation, except that the creature struck gains 2d4 temporary negative levels. Twenty-four hours after gaining them, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw [DC = energy drain spell's save DC] for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4 ? 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
Enervation.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1d4 temporary negative levels [see Special Abilities]. Negative levels stack. Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level [maximum 15 hours]. Usually, negative levels have a chance of becoming permanent, but the negative levels from enervation don't last long enough to do so. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 ? 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
Enlarge Person.MOD	DESC:This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity [to a minimum of 1], and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size. A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check [using its increased Strength] to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it-the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons affected by this spell deal more damage [see Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage]. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession [including a projectile or thrown weapon] instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack. Enlarge person counters and dispels reduce person. Enlarge person can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Enlarge Person (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like enlarge person, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Entangle.MOD	DESC:This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap around foes in the area of effect or those that enter the area. Creatures that fail their save gain the entangled condition. Creatures that make their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of your turn. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail must end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts. If the plants in the area are covered in thorns, those in the area take 1 point of damage each time they fail a save against the entangle or fail a check made to break free. Other effects, depending on the local plants, might be possible at GM discretion.
Enthrall.MOD	DESC:If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell to hold them enthralled. To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly while under the effect of the spell. Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw. A target with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes. The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The speech ends [but the 1d3-round delay still applies] if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing. If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the creature with the highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to assist. The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell. If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously enthralled members become immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile.
Entropic Shield.MOD	DESC:A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker must make an attack roll has a 20%% miss chance [similar to the effects of concealment]. Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not affected.
Erase.MOD	DESC:Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove explosive runes, a glyph of warding, a sepia snake sigil, or an arcane mark, but not illusory script or a symbol spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%%. Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check [1d20 + caster level] against DC 15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase explosive runes, a glyph of warding, or a sepia snake sigil, you accidentally activate that writing instead.
Ethereal Jaunt.MOD	DESC:You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are in the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence. An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material. If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object [such as a solid wall], you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel.
Etherealness.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like ethereal jaunt, except that you and other willing creatures joined by linked hands [along with their equipment] become ethereal. Besides yourself, you can bring one creature per three caster levels to the Ethereal Plane. Once ethereal, the subjects need not stay together. When the spell expires, all affected creatures on the Ethereal Plane return to material existence.
Expeditious Retreat.MOD	DESC:This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance [see the Acrobatics skill].
Explosive Runes.MOD	DESC:You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The explosive runes detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the explosive runes [close enough to read them] takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the explosive runes is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the explosive runes were written also takes full damage [no saving throw]. You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the explosive runes. Likewise, you can remove the explosive runes whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful dispel magic or erase spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the explosive runes and failing to do so triggers the explosion. Magic traps such as explosive runes are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature [only] can use Disable Device to thwart explosive runes. The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for explosive runes.
Eyebite.MOD	DESC:Each round, you can target a single living creature, striking it with waves of power. Depending on the target's HD, this attack has as many as three effects. &nl;HD &pipe; Effect &nl;10 or more &pipe; Sickened &nl;5-9 &pipe; Panicked, sickened &nl;4 or less &pipe; Comatose, panicked, sickened &nl;The effects are cumulative and concurrent. Sickened: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject's body. A creature affected by this spell remains sickened for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a remove disease or heal spell, but a remove curse is effective. Panicked: The subject becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect. Comatose: The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a sleep effect, and thus elves are not immune to it. You must spend a swift action each round after the first to target a foe.

#Block: F
Fabricate.MOD	DESC:You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the fabricate spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet. You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship. Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet of material to be affected by the spell.
Faerie Fire.MOD	DESC:A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by faerie fire take a -20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness [though a 2nd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally], blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.
False Life.MOD	DESC:You harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level [maximum +10].
False Vision.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a subtle illusion, causing any divination [scrying] spell used to view anything within the area of this spell to instead receive a false image [as the major image spell], as defined by you at the time of casting. As long as the duration lasts, you can concentrate to change the image as desired. While you aren't concentrating, the image remains static.
Fear.MOD	DESC:An invisible cone of terror causes each living creature in the area to become panicked unless it succeeds on a Will save. If cornered, a panicked creature begins cowering. If the Will save succeeds, the creature is shaken for 1 round.
Feather Fall.MOD	DESC:The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round [equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet], and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. When the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes. The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures [including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load] or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so forth. This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop. Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.
Feeblemind.MOD	DESC:Target creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell is used to cancel the effect of the feeblemind. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw.
Find the Path.MOD	DESC:The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a prominent specified destination, such as a city, keep, lake, or dungeon. The locale can be outdoors or underground, as long as it is prominent. For example, a hunter's cabin is not prominent enough, but a logging camp is. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as the subject at the time of casting. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense what cavern corridor to take when a choice presents itself. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round, specifying the destination as "outside the maze." This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures [including guardians] who might take action to oppose the caster as he follows the path revealed by this spell.
Find Traps.MOD	DESC:You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps. You gain an insight bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level [maximum +10] on Perception checks made to find traps while the spell is in effect. You receive a check to notice traps within 10 feet of you, even if you are not actively searching for them. Note that find traps grants no ability to disable the traps that you may find.
Finger of Death.MOD	DESC:This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster level. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.
Fire Shield.MOD	DESC:This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you choose cool or warm flames for your fire shield. Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +15]. This damage is either cold damage [if you choose a chill shield] or fire damage [if you choose a warm shield]. If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. The color of the flames is blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or red if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows. Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw. Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.
Fire Seeds.MOD	DESC:Depending on the version of fire seeds you choose, you turn acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on command. Acorn Grenades: As many as four acorns turn into special thrown splash weapons. An acorn grenade has a range increment of 20 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level [maximum 20d4] divided among the acorns as you wish. No acorn can deal more than 10d4 points of damage. Each acorn grenade explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire damage, all creatures adjacent to the explosion take 1 point of fire damage per die of the explosion. This explosion of fire ignites any combustible materials adjacent to the target. Holly Berry Bombs: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons [they can be tossed only 5 feet]. If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. A creature in the area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage.
Fire Storm.MOD	DESC:When a fire storm spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm natural vegetation, ground cover, or any plant creatures in the area that you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creature within the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level [maximum 20d6]. Creatures that fail their Reflex save catch on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage each round until the flames are extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a DC 20 Reflex save.
Fire Trap.MOD	DESC:Fire trap creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A fire trap spell can ward any object that can be opened and closed. When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +20]. The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion. A fire-trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A knock spell does not bypass a fire trap. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam. You can use the fire-trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire-trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends. Magic traps such as fire trap are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a fire trap and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level [DC 27 for a druid's fire trap or DC 29 for the arcane version].
Fireball.MOD	DESC:A fireball spell generates a searing explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level [maximum 10d6] to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure. You point your finger and determine the range [distance and height] at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. An early impact results in an early detonation. If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must "hit" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely. The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
Flame Arrow.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to turn ammunition [such as arrows, crossbow bolts, shuriken, and sling stones] into fiery projectiles. Each piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage to any target it hits. A flaming projectile can easily ignite a flammable object or structure, but it won't ignite a creature it strikes.
Flame Blade.MOD	DESC:A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the flame blade are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels [maximum +10]. Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.
Flame Strike.MOD	DESC:A flame strike evokes a vertical column of divine fire. The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 15d6]. Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.
Flaming Sphere.MOD	DESC:A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would. The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it [a move action for you]; otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A flaming sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
Flare.MOD	DESC:This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst in front of a single creature, that creature is dazzled for 1 minute unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already dazzled, are not affected by flare.
Flesh to Stone.MOD	DESC:The subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject [if ever returned to its original state] has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it does not seem to be alive either when viewed with spells such as deathwatch. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.
Fly.MOD	DESC:The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet [or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load]. It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the fly spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.
Floating Disk.MOD	DESC:You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.
Fog Cloud.MOD	DESC:A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment [attacks have a 20%% miss chance]. Creatures farther away have total concealment [50%% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target]. A moderate wind [11+ mph] disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind [21+ mph] disperses the fog in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.
Forbiddance.MOD	DESC:Forbiddance seals an area against all planar travel into or within it. This includes all teleportation spells [such as dimension door and teleport], plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail automatically. In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours [see below]. A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes no damage unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at which time it is affected as normal. Alignments identical: No effect. The creature may enter the area freely [although not by planar travel]. Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or good/evil: The creature takes 6d6 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies. Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and good/evil: The creature takes 12d6 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies. At your option, the abjuration can include a password, in which case creatures of alignments different from yours can avoid the damage by speaking the password as they enter the area. You must select this option [and the password] at the time of casting. Adding a password requires the burning of additional rare incenses worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube. Dispel magic does not dispel a forbiddance effect unless the dispeller's level is at least as high as your caster level. You can't have multiple overlapping forbiddance effects. In such a case, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older effect.
Forcecage.MOD	DESC:This spell creates an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force [your choice]. Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Like a wall of force, a forcecage resists dispel magic, although a mage's disjunction still functions. The walls of a forcecage can be damaged by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys it. The walls of a forcecage can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but they have a Hardness of 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a sphere of annihilation or rod of cancellation instantly destroys a forcecage. Barred Cage: This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force [similar to a wall of force spell] for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined within the barred cage. You can't attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons [including arrows and similar ranged attacks], a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars. Windowless Cell: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.
Forceful Hand.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as interposing hand, except that it can also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. The forceful hand gets one bull rush attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +8 bonus for its Strength score [27], and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand always moves with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no movement limit for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. Forceful hand prevents the opponent from moving closer to you without first succeeding on a bull rush attack, moving both the forceful hand and the target closer to you. The forceful hand can instead be directed to interpose itself, as interposing hand does.
Foresight.MOD	DESC:This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC. When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating [via an appropriate spell] can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.
Form of the Dragon I.MOD	DESC:You become a Medium chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain a +4 size bonus to Strength, a +2 size bonus to Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus, fly 60 feet [poor], darkvision 60 feet, a breath weapon, and resistance to one element. You also gain one bite [1d8], two claws [1d6], and two wing attacks [1d4]. Your breath weapon and resistance depend on the type of dragon. You can only use the breath weapon once per casting of this spell. All breath weapons deal 6d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save for half damage. In addition, some of the dragon types grant additional abilities, as noted below. Black dragon: 60-foot line of acid, resist acid 20, swim 60 feet Blue dragon: 60-foot line of electricity, resist electricity 20, burrow 20 feet Green dragon: 30-foot cone of acid, resist acid 20, swim 40 feet Red dragon: 30-foot cone of fire, resist fire 30, vulnerability to cold White dragon: 30-foot cone of cold, resist cold 20, swim 60 feet, vulnerability to fire Brass dragon: 60-foot line of fire, resist fire 20, burrow 30 feet, vulnerability to cold Bronze dragon: 60-foot line of electricity, resist electricity 20, swim 60 feet Copper dragon: 60-foot line of acid, resist acid 20, spider climb [always active] Gold dragon: 30-foot cone of fire, resist fire 20, swim 60 feet Silver dragon: 30-foot cone of cold, resist cold 30, vulnerability to fire
Form of the Dragon II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as form of the dragon I except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Large chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to Strength, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, a +6 natural armor bonus, fly 90 feet [poor], darkvision 60 feet, a breath weapon, DR 5/magic, and resistance to one element. You also gain one bite [2d6], two claws [1d8], two wing attacks [1d6], and one tail slap attack [1d8]. You can only use the breath weapon twice per casting of this spell, and you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 8d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save for half damage. Line breath weapons increase to 80-foot lines and cones increase to 40-foot cones.
Form of the Dragon III.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as form of the dragon II save that it also allows you to take the form of a Huge chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain the following abilities: a +10 size bonus to Strength, a +8 size bonus to Constitution, a +8 natural armor bonus, fly 120 feet [poor], blindsense 60 feet, darkvision 120 feet, a breath weapon, DR 10/magic, frightful presence [DC equal to the DC for this spell], and immunity to one element [of the same type form of the dragon I grants resistance to]. You also gain one bite [2d8], two claws [2d6], two wing attacks [1d8], and one tail slap attack [2d6]. You can use the breath weapon as often as you like, but you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 12d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save for half damage. Line breath weapons increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase to 50- foot cones.
Fox's Cunning.MOD	DESC:The target becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-based skill checks and other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards [and other spellcasters who rely on Intelligence] affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase. This spell doesn't grant extra skill ranks.
Fox's Cunning (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like fox's cunning, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Freedom.MOD	DESC:The subject is freed from spells and effects that restrict movement, including binding, entangle, grappling, imprisonment, maze, paralysis, petrification, pinning, sleep, slow, stunning, temporal stasis, and web. To free a creature from imprisonment or maze, you must know its name and background, and you must cast this spell at the spot where it was entombed or banished into the maze.
Freedom of Movement.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis, solid fog, slow, and web. All combat maneuver checks made to grapple the target automatically fail. The subject automatically succeeds on any combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin. The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The freedom of movement spell does not, however, grant water breathing.
Freezing Sphere.MOD	DESC:Freezing sphere creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 40-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level [maximum 15d6] to each creature in the area. A creature of the water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level [maximum 15d8] and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. If the freezing sphere strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water [not including water-based creatures], it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches in a 40-foot radius. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of a targeted body of water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so. You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the freezing sphere bursts centered on you [and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect]. Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.

#Block: G
Gaseous Form.MOD	DESC:The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor [including natural armor] becomes worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains DR 10/magic and becomes immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials. The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect. A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet and automatically succeeds on all Fly skill checks. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.
Gate.MOD	DESC:Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter [caster's choice] oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence [typically vertical and facing you]. It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. A gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not. Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire [a creation effect]. Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you- anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. You may hold the gate open only for a brief time [no more than 1 round per caster level], and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed. Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid [a calling effect]. By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures. If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in "livestock" rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you. Note: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.
Geas (Lesser).MOD	DESC:A lesser geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions. If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas. A lesser geas [and all ability score penalties] can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect a lesser geas.
Geas/Quest.MOD	DESC:This spell functions similarly to lesser geas, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw. If the subject is prevented from obeying the geas/quest for 24 hours, it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas/quest. A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do. Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest.
Gentle Repose.MOD	DESC:You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead [see raise dead]. Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain [and thus decaying] comrade less unpleasant. The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.
Ghost Sound.MOD	DESC:Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character. The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level [maximum 40 humans]. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans. Anyone who hears a ghost sound receives a Will save to disbelieve. Ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell. Ghost sound can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Ghoul Touch.MOD	DESC:Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a single living humanoid for the duration of the spell with a successful melee touch attack. A paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures [except you] in a 10-foot-radius spread to become sickened [Fortitude negates]. A neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench.
Giant Form I.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell you can assume the form of any Large humanoid creature of the giant subtype. Once you assume your new form, you gain the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to Strength, a -2 penalty to Dexterity, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus, and lowlight vision. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: darkvision 60 feet, rend [2d6 damage], regeneration 5, rock catching, and rock throwing [range 60 feet, 2d6 damage]. If the creature has immunity or resistance to any elements, you gain resistance 20 to those elements. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability.
Giant Form II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as giant form I except that it also allows you to assume the form of any Huge creature of the giant type. You gain the following abilities: a +8 size bonus to Strength, a -2 penalty to Dexterity, a +6 size bonus to Constitution, a +6 natural armor bonus, low-light vision, and a +10 foot enhancement bonus to your speed. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: swim 60 feet, darkvision 60 feet, rend [2d8 damage], regeneration 5, rock catching, and rock throwing [range 120 feet, 2d10 damage]. If the creature has immunity or resistance to one element, you gain that immunity or resistance. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability.
Giant Vermin.MOD	DESC:You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted [so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider]. The number of vermin which can be affected by this spell depends on your caster level, as noted on the table below. Giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands ["Attack," "Defend," "Stop," and so forth]. Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whomever or whatever is near them. &nl;Caster Level Centipedes Scorpions Spiders &nl;9th or lower &pipe; 3 &pipe; 1 &pipe; 2 &nl;10th-13th &pipe; 4 &pipe; 2 &pipe; 3 &nl;14th-17th &pipe; 6 &pipe; 3 &pipe; 4 &nl;18th-19th &pipe; 8 &pipe; 4 &pipe; 5 &nl;20th or higher &pipe; 12 &pipe; 6 &pipe; 8
Glibness.MOD	DESC:Your speech becomes fluent and more believable, causing those who hear you to believe every word you say. You gain a +20 bonus on Bluff checks made to convince another of the truth of your words. This bonus doesn't apply to other uses of the Bluff skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a hidden message via innuendo. If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check [1d20 + caster level] against a DC of 15 + your caster level to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth.
Glitterdust.MOD	DESC:A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. Each round at the end of their turn blinded creatures may attempt new saving throws to end the blindness effect. Any creature covered by the dust takes a -40 penalty on Stealth checks.
Globe of Invulnerability.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser globe of invulnerability, except that it also excludes 4th-level spells and spell-like effects.
Globe of Invulnerability (Lesser).MOD	DESC:An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a dispel magic spell. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty. Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled. If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it.
Glyph of Warding.MOD	DESC:This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password [which you set when casting the spell] is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics [such as height or weight] or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded. When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. Mislead, polymorph, and nondetection [and similar magical effects] can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. Read magic allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Knowledge [arcana] check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph [version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored]. Note: Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding. Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell. Blast Glyph: A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d8] to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic [caster's choice, made at time of casting]. Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect. Spell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph.
Glyph of Warding (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like glyph of warding, except that a greater blast glyph deals up to 10d8 points of damage, and a greater spell glyph can store a spell of 6th level or lower. Read magic allows you to identify a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check. Material Component: You trace the glyph with incense, which must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 400 gp.
Goodberry.MOD	DESC:Casting goodberry makes 2d4 freshly picked berries magical. You [as well as any other druid of 3rd or higher level] can immediately discern which berries are affected. Each transmuted berry provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature. The berry also cures 1 point of damage when eaten, subject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing in any 24-hour period.
Good Hope.MOD	DESC:This spell instills powerful hope in the subjects. Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Good hope counters and dispels crushing despair
Grasping Hand.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as interposing hand, except that it can also grapple one opponent you select. The grasping hand gets one grapple attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +10 bonus for its Strength [31] score and a +1 bonus for being Large [its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus on the Combat Maneuver Defense]. The hand holds but does not harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The grasping hand can instead be directed to bull rush a target, using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as interposing hand does.
Grease.MOD	DESC:A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round [and must then make a Reflex save or fall], while failure by 5 or more means it falls [see the Acrobatics skill for details]. Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed. The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.
Guards and Wards.MOD	DESC:This powerful spell is primarily used to defend a stronghold or fortress by creating a number of magical wards and effects. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area. Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment [attacks have a 20%% miss chance]. Creatures farther away have total concealment [50%% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target]. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no. Arcane Locks: All doors in the warded area are arcane locked. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no. Webs: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for web. Spell Resistance: no. Confusion: Where there are choices in direction-such as a corridor intersection or side passage-a minor confusiontype effect functions so as to make it 50%% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: yes. Lost Doors: One door per caster level is covered by a silent image to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief [if interacted with]. Spell Resistance: no. In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects. 1. Dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no. 2. A magic mouth in two places. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no. 3. A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for stinking cloud. Spell Resistance: no. 4. A gust of wind in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: yes. 5. A suggestion in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: yes. The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful mage's disjunction destroys the entire guards and wards effect.
Guidance.MOD	DESC:This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance. The creature gets a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.
Gust of Wind.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a severe blast of air [approximately 50 mph] that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a -4 penalty on Fly skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be blown back 2d6 ? 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly skill check to move against the force of the wind. A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 ? 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check. Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect. This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of it's range. Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a gust of wind. The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50%% chance to extinguish those lights. In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range. Gust of wind can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

#Block: H
Hallow.MOD	DESC:Hallow makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects. First, the site is warded by a magic circle against evil effect. Second, the DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to resist negative energy is reduced by 4. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell. Third, any dead body interred in a hallowed site cannot be turned into an undead creature. Finally, you can fix a single spell effect to the hallowed site. The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting hallow again. Spell effects that may be tied to a hallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. [See the individual spell descriptions for details.] An area can receive only one hallow spell [and its associated spell effect] at a time. Hallow counters but does not dispel unhallow.
Hallucinatory Terrain.MOD	DESC:You make natural terrain look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.
Halt Undead.MOD	DESC:This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell [similar to the effect of hold person on a living creature]. The effect is broken if the halted creatures are attacked or take damage.
Harm.MOD	DESC:Harm charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level [to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level]. If the creature successfully saves, harm deals half this amount. Harm cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1. If used on an undead creature, harm acts like heal.
Haste.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects. When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. [This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a speed weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.] A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class [if any] also makes you lose dodge bonuses. All of the hasted creature's modes of movement [including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim] increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple haste effects don't stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.
Heal.MOD	DESC:Heal enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level. Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm.
Heal (Mass).MOD	DESC:Heal enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 250 points. Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm.
Heal Mount.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like heal, but it affects only the paladin's special mount [typically a horse].
Heat Metal.MOD	DESC:Heat metal causes metal objects to become red-hot. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher. A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage [1 point or 2 points; see the table] if it's not wearing or wielding such an item. On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second [and also the next-to-last] round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, and causes more damage, as shown on the table below. &nl;Round &pipe; Metal Temperature &pipe; Damage &nl;1 &pipe; Warm &pipe; None &nl;2 &pipe; Hot &pipe; 1d4 points &nl;3-5 &pipe; Searing &pipe; 2d4 points &nl;6 &pipe; Hot &pipe; 1d4 points &nl;7 &pipe; Warm &pipe; None &nl;Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell [and vice versa] on a point-for-point basis. If cast underwater, heat metal deals half damage and boils the surrounding water. Heat metal counters and dispels chill metal.
Helping Hand.MOD	DESC:You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow. When the spell is cast, you specify a person [or any creature] by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is done, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away he is, as detailed on the following table. &nl;Distance &pipe; Time to Locate &nl;100 ft. or less &pipe; 1 round &nl;1,000 ft. &pipe; 1 minute &nl;1 mile &pipe; 10 minutes &nl;2 miles &pipe; 1 hour &nl;3 miles &pipe; 2 hours &nl;4 miles &pipe; 3 hours &nl;5 miles &pipe; 4 hours &nl;Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears. The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on its own devices to locate you. If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject. If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm [indicating that no such creature was found], and disappears. The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.
Heroes' Feast.MOD	DESC:You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table, chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Every creature partaking of the feast is cured of all sickness and nausea, receives the benefits of both neutralize poison and remove disease, and gains 1d8 temporary hit points + 1 point per two caster levels [maximum +10] after imbibing the nectar-like beverage that is part of the feast. The ambrosial food grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and Will saves and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against poison and fear effects for 12 hours. If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.
Heroism.MOD	DESC:This spell imbues a single creature with great bravery and morale in battle. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks.
Heroism (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like heroism, except the creature gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and temporary hit points equal to your caster level [maximum 20].
Hide from Animals.MOD	DESC:Animals cannot sense the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.
Hide from Undead.MOD	DESC:Undead cannot see, hear, or smell creatures warded by this spell. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures [such as skeletons or zombies] are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there. An intelligent undead creature gets a single Will saving throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any of the warded creatures. If it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, however, it can attempt to find or strike them. If a warded creature attempts to channel positive energy, turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature [even with a spell], the spell ends for all recipients.
Hideous Laughter.MOD	DESC:This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally. On the creature's next turn, it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save is successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues laughing for the entire duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't "translate" well.
Hold Animal.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects an animal instead of a humanoid.
Hold Monster.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects any living creature that fails its Will save.
Hold Monster (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects multiple creatures and holds any living creature that fails its Will save.
Hold Person.MOD	DESC:The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.
Hold Person (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hold person, except as noted above.
Hold Portal.MOD	DESC:This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A knock spell or a successful dispel magic spell can negate a hold portal spell. Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this spell.
Holy Aura.MOD	DESC:A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike protection from evil, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures. Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures. Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from possession and mental influence, just as protection from evil does. Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a holy aura, the offending attacker is blinded [Fortitude save negates, as blindness/deafness, but against holy aura's save DC].
Holy Smite.MOD	DESC:You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d8] to each evil creature in the area [or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider] and causes it to become blinded for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect. The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a creature can reduce that damage by half [down to one-quarter of the roll] with a successful Will save.
Holy Sword.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a +5 holy weapon [+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents]. It also emits a magic circle against evil effect [as the spell]. If the magic circle ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one holy sword at a time. If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supercede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with bless weapon or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.
Holy Word.MOD	DESC:Any nongood creature within the area of a holy word spell suffers the following ill effects. &nl;HD Effect &nl;Equal to caster level &pipe; Deafened &nl;Up to caster level -1 &pipe; Blinded, deafened &nl;Up to caster level -5 &pipe; Paralyzed, blinded, deafened &nl;Up to caster level -10 &pipe; Killed, paralyzed, blinded, deafened &nl;The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects. Deafened: The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds. Save negates. Blinded: The creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds. Save reduces the blinded effect to 1d4 rounds. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. Save reduces the paralyzed effect to 1 round. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +25]. Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nongood extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the holy word or not. The banishment effect allows a Will save [at a -4 penalty] to negate. Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by holy word.
Horrid Wilting.MOD	DESC:This spell evaporates moisture from the body of each subject living creature, causing flesh to wither and crack and crumble to dust. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 20d6]. This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, which instead take 1d8 points of damage per caster level [maximum 20d8].
Hypnotic Pattern.MOD	DESC:A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air, fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your caster level [maximum 10] to determine the total number of HD of creatures affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures become fascinated by the pattern of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected. A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must perform as a verbal component.
Hypnotism.MOD	DESC:Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total HD of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be fascinated. If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of - 2. While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature [provided you can communicate with it]. The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request. A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.

#Block: I, J, K
Ice Storm.MOD	DESC:Great magical hailstones pound down upon casting this spell, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area. This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, heavy snow and sleet rains down in the area. Creatures inside this area take a -4 penalty on Perception skill checks and the entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the snow and hail disappear, leaving no aftereffects [other than the damage dealt].
Identify.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as detect magic, except that it gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This spell does not allow you to identify artifacts.
Illusory Script.MOD	DESC:You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The illusory script appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person [or people] designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character. Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include "Close the book and leave," "Forget the existence of this note," and so forth. If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.
Illusory Wall.MOD	DESC:This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear. Although the caster can see through his illusory wall, other creatures cannot, even if they succeed at their will save [but they do learn that it is not real].
Imbue with Spell Ability.MOD	DESC:You transfer some of your currently prepared spells, and the ability to cast them, to another creature. Only a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 5 and a Wisdom score of at least 9 can receive this boon. Only cleric spells from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration [healing] can be transferred. The number and level of spells that the subject can be granted depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of imbue with spell ability can't exceed this limit. &nl;HD of Recipient &pipe; Spells Imbued &nl;2 or lower &pipe; One 1st-level spell &nl;3-4 &pipe; One or two 1st-level spells &nl;5 or higher &pipe; One or two 1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell &nl;The transferred spell's variable characteristics [range, duration, area, and the like] function according to your level, not the level of the recipient. Once you cast imbue with spell ability, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it until the recipient uses the imbued spells or is slain, or until you dismiss the imbue with spell ability spell. In the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put. If the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active imbue with spell ability spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled. To cast a spell with a verbal component, the subject must be able to speak. To cast a spell with a somatic component, it must be able to move freely. To cast a spell with a material component or focus, it must have the materials or focus.
Implosion.MOD	DESC:This spell causes a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature's body. Each round you concentrate [including the first], you can cause one creature to collapse in on itself, inflicting 10 points of damage per caster level. If you break concentration, the spell immediately ends, though any implosions that have already happened remain in effect. You can target a particular creature only once with each casting of the spell. Implosion has no effect on creatures in gaseous form or on incorporeal creatures.
Imprisonment.MOD	DESC:When you cast imprisonment and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation [see the temporal stasis spell] in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a freedom spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but discern location does. A wish or miracle spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a -4 penalty on its save.
Incendiary Cloud.MOD	DESC:An incendiary cloud spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a fog cloud does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 6d6 points of fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make Reflex saves each round to take half damage. As with a cloudkill spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud move as much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder's spread thereafter. As with fog cloud, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can't be cast underwater.
Inflict Critical Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like inflict light wounds, except that you deal 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +20].
Inflict Critical Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass inflict light wounds, except that it deals 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +40].
Inflict Light Wounds.MOD	DESC:When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that deals 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +5]. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.
Inflict Light Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:Negative energy spreads out in all directions from the point of origin, dealing 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +25] to nearby living enemies. Like other inflict spells, mass inflict light wounds cures undead in its area rather than damaging them. A cleric capable of spontaneously casting inflict spells can also spontaneously cast mass inflict spells.
Inflict Moderate Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like inflict light wounds, except that you deal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +10].
Inflict Moderate Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass inflict light wounds, except that it deals 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +30].
Inflict Serious Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like inflict light wounds, except that you deal 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +15].
Inflict Serious Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass inflict light wounds, except that it deals 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +35].
Insanity.MOD	DESC:The affected creature suffers from a continuous confusion effect, as the spell. Remove curse does not remove insanity. Greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish can restore the creature.
Insect Plague.MOD	DESC:You summon a number of swarms of wasps [one per three levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level]. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm [that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area]. You may summon the wasp swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and won't pursue creatures that flee.
Instant Summons.MOD	DESC:You call some nonliving item directly to your hand from virtually any location. First, you must place your arcane mark on the item. Then you cast this spell, which magically and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on a sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word [set by you when the spell is cast] and crushing the gem. The item appears instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way. If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but you know who the possessor is and roughly where that creature is located when the summons occurs. The inscription on the gem is invisible. It is also unreadable, except by means of a read magic spell, to anyone but you. The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other creature has claimed ownership of it.
Interposing Hand.MOD	DESC:Interposing hand creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover [+4 AC] for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand-it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however. An interposing hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and is AC 20 [-1 size, +11 natural]. It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it. The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field, but it suffers the full effect of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The hand makes saving throws as its caster. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it. Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature's attacks. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.
Invisibility.MOD	DESC:The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so [thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source]. Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable [such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle]. If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Invisibility can be made permanent [on objects only] with a permanency spell.
Invisibility (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like invisibility, except that it doesn't end if the subject attacks.
Invisibility (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like invisibility, except that the effect moves with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in the group cannot see each other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group. If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet.
Invisibility Purge.MOD	DESC:You surround yourself with a sphere of power with a radius of 5 feet per caster level that negates all forms of invisibility. Anything invisible becomes visible while in the area.
Invisibility Sphere.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like invisibility, except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient at the time the spell is cast. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient. Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures [other than the recipient] who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility sphere ends.
Iron Body.MOD	DESC:This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities. You gain damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a -6 penalty to Dexterity as well [to a minimum Dexterity score of 1], and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 35%% and a -6 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink [and thus can't use potions] or play wind instruments. Your unarmed attack deals damage equal to a club sized for you [1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters], and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. Your weight increases by a factor of 10, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the lack of air at the bottom of the ocean-at least until the spell duration expires.
Ironwood.MOD	DESC:Ironwood is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, ironwood is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on ironwood. Spells that affect wood do affect ironwood, although ironwood does not burn. Using this spell with wood shape or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids. Further, if you make only half as much ironwood as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.
Irresistible Dance.MOD	DESC:The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and a -10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this effect to 1 round.
Jump.MOD	DESC:The subject gets a +10 enhancement bonus on Acrobatics checks made to attempt high jumps or long jumps. The enhancement bonus increases to +20 at caster level 5th, and to +30 [the maximum] at caster level 9th.
Keen Edge.MOD	DESC:This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19- 20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell. Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range [such as the keen special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat] don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.
Knock.MOD	DESC:Knock opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to hold portal or arcane lock. When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, knock opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains [provided they serve to hold something shut]. If used to open an arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments [such as a portcullis], nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.
Know Direction.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you instantly know the direction of north from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which "north" exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don't find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction.

#Block: L
Legend Lore.MOD	DESC:Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4 x 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific [though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time]. If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete [though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time]. During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends [if any] about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are "legendary," as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.
Levitate.MOD	DESC:Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally [generally at half its base land speed]. A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.
Light.MOD	DESC:This spell causes a touched object to glow like a torch, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius, and increasing the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step, up to normal light [darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light]. In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object. You can only have one light spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent [through permanency or a similar effect], it does not count against this limit. Light can be used to counter or dispel any darkness spell of equal or lower spell level.
Lightning Bolt.MOD	DESC:You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level [maximum 10d6] to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips. The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
Limited Wish.MOD	DESC:A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things. . Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools. . Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools. . Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools. . Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools. . Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as or insanity. . Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a - 7 penalty on its next saving throw. A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component [in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell].
Liveoak.MOD	DESC:This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can only be cast on a single tree at a time; while liveoak is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. Liveoak must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant. If liveoak is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.
Locate Creature.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like locate object, except this spell locates a known creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any. The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close [within 30 feet] at least once. Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells.
Locate Object.MOD	DESC:You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which case you locate the nearest of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand [not through divination]. The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. Polymorph any object and nondetection fool it.
Longstrider.MOD	DESC:This spell gives you a +10 foot enhancement bonus to your base speed. It has no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim.
Lullaby.MOD	DESC:Any creature within the area that fails a Will save becomes drowsy and inattentive, taking a -5 penalty on Perception checks and a -2 penalty on Will saves against sleep effects while the lullaby is in effect. Lullaby lasts for as long as the caster concentrates, plus up to 1 round per caster level thereafter.

#Block: M
Mage Armor.MOD	DESC:An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a mage armor spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC. Unlike mundane armor, mage armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since mage armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
Mage Hand.MOD	DESC:You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell's range.
Mage's Disjunction.MOD	DESC:All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are unraveled and destroyed completely [ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does], and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item for the duration of this spell. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher. If an item's saving throw results in a natural 1 on the die, the item is destroyed instead of being suppressed. You also have a 1%% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined. You can also use this spell to target a single item. The item gets a Will save at a -5 penalty to avoid being permanently destroyed. Even artifacts are subject to mage's disjunction, though there is only a 1%% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. If successful, the artifact's power unravels, and it is destroyed [with no save]. If an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even miracle or wish. Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95%% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.
Mage's Faithful Hound.MOD	DESC:You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured [it does not move]. The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. [Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.] The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions. If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite [+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage] once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature [see invisibility]. The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.
Mage's Lucubration.MOD	DESC:You instantly prepare any one spell of 5th level or lower that you have used during the past 24 hours. The spell must have been actually cast during that period. The chosen spell is stored in your mind as through prepared in the normal fashion. If the recalled spell requires material components, you must provide them. The recovered spell is not usable until the material components are available.
Mage's Magnificent Mansion.MOD	DESC:You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants [as many as two per caster level], liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as unseen servant spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion. Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.
Mage's Private Sanctum.MOD	DESC:This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally. Divination [scrying] spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to detect thoughts. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside [because it blocks sound], but it does not prevent other communication, such as a sending or message spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar. The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area. Mage's private sanctum can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Mage's Sword.MOD	DESC:This spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus [for wizards or sorcerers, respectively] with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19-20 and a critical multiplier of ?2. The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, goes out of your sight, or you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target. The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The sword's AC is 13 [10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus]. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time mage's sword strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
Magic Aura.MOD	DESC:You alter an item's aura so that it registers to detect spells [and spells with similar capabilities] as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. If the object bearing magic aura has identify cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is. If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful [if it is an artifact, for instance], magic aura doesn't work. Note: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.
Magic Circle against Chaos.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from chaos instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonlawful called creature.
Magic Circle against Evil.MOD	DESC:All creatures within the area gain the effects of a protection from evil spell, and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either. Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay [as in the third function of protection from evil], but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature [such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells] for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel [astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities] can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks [ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like] can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram [a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils] to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap [see the lesser planar binding spell], the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.
Magic Circle against Good.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from good instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.
Magic Circle against Law.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from law instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.
Magic Fang.MOD	DESC:Magic fang gives one natural weapon or unarmed strike of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural weapon. The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage. Magic fang can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Magic Fang (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like magic fang, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels [maximum +5]. This bonus does not allow a natural weapon or unarmed strike to bypass damage reduction aside from magic. Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus [regardless of your caster level]. Greater magic fang can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Magic Jar.MOD	DESC:By casting magic jar, you place your soul in a gem or large crystal [known as the magic jar], leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar [thereby returning the trapped soul to its body] and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level [and on the same plane of existence]. You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. [Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.] You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again. If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks [or more advantageous two-weapon attacks] than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs [it is dead]. If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body [or die if your body is out of range or destroyed]. If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body [or die, if it is out of range of your current position], and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body [or dies if it is out of range]. Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or the host's location.
Magic Missile.MOD	DESC:A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage. The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile-two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.
Magic Mouth.MOD	DESC:This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be 25 or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Magic mouth can also be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance. Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Magic Stone.MOD	DESC:You transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets [range increment 50 feet]. The spell gives them a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The user of the stones makes a normal ranged attack. Each stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage [including the spell's enhancement bonus], or 2d6+2 points against undead.
Magic Vestment.MOD	DESC:You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus of +1 per four caster levels [maximum +5 at 20th level]. An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.
Magic Weapon.MOD	DESC:Magic weapon gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike [instead, see magic fang]. A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.
Magic Weapon (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like magic weapon, except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels [maximum +5]. This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass damage reduction aside from magic. Alternatively, you can affect as many as 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together [in the same quiver or other container]. Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation after they are used. Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.
Major Creation.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like minor creation, except that you can also create an object of mineral nature: stone, crystal, metal, or the like. The duration of the created item varies with its relative hardness and rarity, as indicated on the following table. &nl;Hardness and Rarity &pipe; Examples Duration &nl;Vegetable matter &pipe; 2 hr./level &nl;Stone, crystal, base metals &pipe; 1 hr./level &nl;Precious metals &pipe; 20 min./level &nl;Gems &pipe; 10 min./level &nl;Rare metal* &pipe; 1 round/level &nl;* Includes adamantine, alchemical silver, and mithral. You can't use major creation to create a cold iron item.
Major Image.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like silent image, except that sound, smell, and thermal illusions are included in the spell effect. While concentrating, you can move the image within the range. The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately.
Make Whole.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as mending, except that it repairs 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on a construct creature [maximum 5d6]. Make whole can fix destroyed magic items [at 0 hit points or less], and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with charges [such as wands] and single-use items [such as potions and scrolls] cannot be repaired in this way. When make whole is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance
Mark of Justice.MOD	DESC:You mark a subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of undesirable behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of bestow curse. Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained. Like the effect of bestow curse, a mark of justice cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Remove curse works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your mark of justice caster level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated.
Maze.MOD	DESC:You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the subject. On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a maze spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.
Meld into Stone.MOD	DESC:Meld into stone enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted. While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction [to the extent that you no longer fit within it] expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage. Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage. The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying. Stone to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. Stone shape deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. Transmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, passwall expels you without damage.
Mending.MOD	DESC:This spell repairs damaged objects, restoring 1d4 hit points to the object. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of an object must be present for this spell to function. Magic items can be repaired by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than that of the object. Magic items that are destroyed [at 0 hit points or less] can be repaired with this spell, but this spell does not restore their magic abilities. This spell does not affect creatures [including constructs]. This spell has no effect on objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still repair damage done to such items.
Message.MOD	DESC:You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies. Those nearby can hear these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal [or a thin sheet of lead], or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning; it doesn't transcend language barriers. To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper.
Meteor Swarm.MOD	DESC:Meteor swarm is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to fireball in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2- foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks. If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage [no save] and takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw against the sphere's fire damage [see below]. If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target. Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40- foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. Despite stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is applied only once.
Mind Blank.MOD	DESC:The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information about the target through divination magic [such as detect evil, locate creature, scry, and see invisible]. This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. Mind blank even foils limited wish, miracle, and wish spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as arcane eye, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.
Mind Fog.MOD	DESC:Mind fog produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the mind fog take a -10 penalty on Wisdom checks and Will saves. [A creature that successfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.] Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes [or until dispersed by wind]. A moderate wind [11+ mph] disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind [21+ mph] disperses the fog in 1 round. The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper vision.
Minor Creation.MOD	DESC:You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. You must succeed on an appropriate Craft skill check to make a complex item. Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail.
Minor Image.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like silent image, except that minor image includes some minor sounds but not understandable speech.
Miracle.MOD	DESC:You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity [or the power you pray to for spells] intercede. A miracle can do any of the following things. . Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower. . Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower. . Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity. . Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a miracle costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following: . Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting. . Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error. . Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster. In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's [or alignment's] nature is refused. A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.
Mirage Arcana.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hallucinatory terrain, except that it enables you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike hallucinatory terrain, the spell can alter the appearance of structures [or add them where none are present]. Still, it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures [though creatures within the area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide themselves within a real location].
Mirror Image.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you. When mirror image is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels [maximum eight images total] are created. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment. An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect [although the normal miss chances still apply].
Misdirection.MOD	DESC:By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras [detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like]. On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of misdirection is detected as if it were the other object. Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect. Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic [augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like].
Mislead.MOD	DESC:You become invisible [as greater invisibility, a glamer], and at the same time, an illusory double of you [as major image, a figment] appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it [which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting]. You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so. The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The greater invisibility lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.
Mnemonic Enhancer.MOD	DESC:Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or retain spells recently cast. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is cast. Prepare: You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally. Retain: You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the mnemonic enhancer. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind. In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours [if not cast].
Modify Memory.MOD	DESC:You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways. . Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate charm, geas/quest, suggestion, or similar spells. . Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced. . Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced. . Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced. Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes [a period of time equal to the amount of memory you want to modify] visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost. A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream, too much wine, or another similar excuse.
Moment of Prescience.MOD	DESC:This spell grants you a sixth sense. Once during the spell's duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level [maximum +25] on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack [even if flat-footed]. Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another character's turn. You must choose to use the moment of prescience before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one moment of prescience active on you at the same time.
Mount.MOD	DESC:You summon a light horse or a pony [your choice] to serve you as a mount. The steed serves willingly and well. The mount comes with a bit and bridle and a riding saddle.
Move Earth.MOD	DESC:Move earth moves dirt [clay, loam, sand, and soil], possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth. In no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square [up to 10 feet deep], casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move. This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacial fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography. The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle. This spell has no effect on earth creatures.

#Block: N, O
Neutralize Poison.MOD	DESC:You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check [1d20 + caster level] against the DC of each poison affecting the target. Success means that the poison is neutralized. A cured creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own. This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for 10 minutes per level, at the caster's option. If cast on a creature, the creature receives a Will save to negate the effect.
Nightmare.MOD	DESC:You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours. The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge the subject and the physical connection [if any] you have to that creature. &nl;Knowledge &pipe; Will Save Modifier &nl;None* &pipe; +10 &nl;Secondhand [you have heard of the subject] &pipe; +5 &nl;Firsthand [you have met the subject] &pipe; +0 &nl;Familiar [you know the subject well] &pipe; -5 &nl;Connection &pipe; Will Save Modifier &nl;Likeness or picture &pipe; -2 &nl;Possession or garment &pipe; -4 &nl;Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. &pipe; -10 &nl;*You must have some sort of connection to a creature of which you have no knowledge. &nl;Dispel evil cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the nightmare and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the dispel evil. If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting [ending the spell] or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the spell ends. If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance. You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. [You always fail Reflex and Will saving throws, for example.] Creatures who don't sleep [such as elves, but not half-elves] or dream are immune to this spell.
Nondetection.MOD	DESC:The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect spells. Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check [1d20 + caster level] against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level. If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.
Obscure Object.MOD	DESC:This spell hides an object from location by divination [scrying] effects, such as the scrying spell or a crystal ball. Such an attempt automatically fails [if the divination is targeted on the object] or fails to perceive the object [if the divination is targeted on a nearby location, object, or person].
Obscuring Mist.MOD	DESC:A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment [attacks have a 20%% miss chance]. Creatures farther away have total concealment [50%% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target]. A moderate wind [11+ mph], such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind [21+ mph] disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage. This spell does not function underwater.
Open/Close.MOD	DESC:You can open or close [your choice] a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity [such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest], the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.
Order's Wrath.MOD	DESC:You channel lawful power to smite enemies. The power takes the form of a three-dimensional grid of energy. Only chaotic and neutral [not lawful] creatures are harmed by the spell. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d8] to chaotic creatures [or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders] and causes them to be dazed for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect. The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. They can reduce the damage in half again [down to one-quarter of the roll] with a successful Will save.
Overland Flight.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like a fly spell, except you can fly at a speed of 40 feet [30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load] with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to half your caster level. When using this spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage [a forced march still requires Constitution checks]. This means you can cover 64 miles in an 8-hour period of flight [or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet].
Owl's Wisdom.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids, and rangers [and other Wisdom-based spellcasters] who receive owl's wisdom do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells increase
Owl's Wisdom (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like owl's wisdom, except that it affects multiple creatures.

#Block: P, Q
Passwall.MOD	DESC:You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th [15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level]. If the wall's thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the passwall or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.
Pass without Trace.MOD	DESC:The subject or subjects of this spell do not leave footprints or a scent trail while moving. Tracking the subjects is impossible by nonmagical means.
Permanency.MOD	DESC:This spell makes the duration of certain other spells permanent. You first cast the desired spell and then follow it with the permanency spell. Depending on the spell, you must be of a minimum caster level and must expend a specific gp value of diamond dust as a material component. You can make the following spells permanent in regard to yourself. [Spell Minimum Caster Level GP Cost]; [Arcane sight 11th 7,500 gp]; [Comprehend languages 9th 2,500 gp]; [Darkvision 10th 5,000 gp]; [Detect magic 9th 2,500 gp]; [Read magic 9th 2,500 gp]; [See invisibility 10th 5,000 gp]; [Tongues 11th 7,500 gp]; You cannot cast these spells on other creatures. This application of permanency can be dispelled only by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell. In addition to personal use, permanency can be used to make the following spells permanent on yourself, another creature, or an object [as appropriate]. [Spell Minimum Caster Level GP Cost]; [Enlarge person 9th 2,500 gp]; [Magic fang 9th 2,500 gp]; [Magic fang, greater 11th 7,500 gp]; [Reduce person 9th 2,500 gp]; [Resistance 9th 2,500 gp]; [Telepathic bond* 13th 12,500 gp]; *Only bonds two creatures per casting of permanency. Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and rendered permanent. [Spell Minimum Caster Level GP Cost]; [Alarm 9th 2,500 gp]; [Animate objects 14th 15,000 gp]; [Dancing lights 9th 2,500 gp]; [Ghost sound 9th 2,500 gp]; [Gust of wind 11th 7,500 gp]; [Invisibility 10th 5,000 gp]; [Mage's private sanctum 13th 12,500 gp]; [Magic mouth 10th 5,000 gp]; [Phase door 15th 17,500 gp]; [Prismatic sphere 17th 22,500 gp]; [Prismatic wall 16th 20,000 gp]; [Shrink item 11th 7,500 gp]; [Solid fog 12th 10,000 gp]; [Stinking cloud 11th 7,500 gp]; [Symbol of death 16th 20,000 gp]; [Symbol of fear 14th 15,000 gp]; [Symbol of insanity 16th 20,000 gp]; [Symbol of pain 13th 12,500 gp]; [Symbol of persuasion 14th 15,000 gp]; [Symbol of sleep 16th 20,000 gp]; [Symbol of stunning 15th 17,500 gp]; [Symbol of weakness 15th 17,500 gp]; [Teleportation circle 17th 22,500 gp]; [Wall of fire 12th 10,000 gp]; [Wall of force 13th 7,500 gp]; [Web 10th 5,000 gp]; Spells cast on other targets are vulnerable to dispel magic as normal. The GM may allow other spells to be made permanent.
Permanent Image.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like silent image, except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, and the spell is permanent. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating.
Persistent Image.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like silent image, except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and the figment follows a script determined by you. The figment follows that script without your having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if you wish.
Phantasmal Killer.MOD	DESC:You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage. If the subject of a phantasmal killer attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.
Phantom Steed.MOD	DESC:You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature [the exact coloration can be customized as you wish]. It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it. The mount is AC 18 [-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex] and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level. These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels. 8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed. 10th Level: The mount can use water walk at will [as the spell, no action required to activate this ability]. 12th Level: The mount can use air walk at will [as the spell, no action required to activate this ability] for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground. 14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.
Phantom Trap.MOD	DESC:This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is "sprung"; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time. If another phantom trap is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails.
Phase Door.MOD	DESC:This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when you enter the phase door and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature [Medium or smaller] through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A gem of true seeing or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but does not allow its use. A phase door is subject to dispel magic. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a passwall effect. You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify. Phase door can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Planar Ally.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser planar ally, except you may call a single creature of 12 HD or less, or two creatures of the same kind whose HD total no more than 12. The creatures agree to help you and request your return payment together.
Planar Ally (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser planar ally, except that you may call a single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. The creatures agree to help you and request your return payment together.
Planar Ally (Lesser).MOD	DESC:By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an outsider [of 6 HD or less] of the deity's choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell [though you might get a different creature anyway]. You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services. The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD. A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal [remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature]. However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment. At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane [after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible]. Note: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
Planar Binding.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser planar binding, except that you may call a single creature of 12 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 12. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.
Planar Binding (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser planar binding, except that you may call a single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.
Planar Binding (Lesser).MOD	DESC:Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell. The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap [spell resistance does not keep it from being called]. The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check [DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier]. It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram [see magic circle against evil] to make the trap more secure. If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free [with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped]. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
Plane Shift.MOD	DESC:You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles [5d%%] from your intended destination. Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back [including casting plane shift again].
Plant Growth.MOD	DESC:Plant growth has different effects depending on the version chosen. Overgrowth: This effect causes normal vegetation [grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, and so on] within long range [400 feet + 40 feet per caster level] to become thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures. The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect. If this spell is cast on an area that is already affected by any spell or effect that enhances plants, such as entangle or wall of thorns, any DC involved with these spells is increased by 4. This bonus is granted for 1 day after the casting of plant growth. At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter circle. You may designate places within the area that are not affected. Enrichment: This effect targets plants within a range of a half-mile, raising their potential productivity over the course of the next year to one-third above normal. Plant growth counters diminish plants. This spell has no effect on plant creatures.
Plant Shape I.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell you can assume the form of any Small or Medium creature of the plant type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, constrict, grab, and poison. If the form you assume does not possess the ability to move, your speed is reduced to 5 feet and you lose all other forms of movement. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability. Small plant: If the form you take is that of a Small plant, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Constitution and a +2 natural armor bonus. Medium plant: If the form you take is that of a Medium plant, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength, a +2 enhancement bonus to your Constitution, and a +2 natural armor bonus.
Plant Shape II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as plant shape I except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Large creature of the plant type. If the creature has immunity or resistance to any elements, you gain resistance 20 to those elements. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability. Large plant: If the form you take is that of a Large plant, you gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a +2 size bonus to your Constitution, and a +4 natural armor bonus.
Plant Shape III.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as plant shape II except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Huge creature of the plant type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: DR, regeneration 5, and trample. Huge plant: If the form you take is that of a Huge plant, you gain a +8 size bonus to your Strength, a -2 penalty to your Dexterity, a +4 size bonus to your Constitution, and a +6 natural armor bonus.
Poison.MOD	DESC:Calling upon the venomous powers of natural predators, you infect the subject with a horrible poison by making a successful melee touch attack. This poison deals 1d3 Constitution damage per round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage and end the affliction.
Polar Ray.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:A blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level [maximum 25d6] and 1d4 points of Dexterity drain.
Polymorph.MOD	DESC:This spell transforms a willing creature into an animal, humanoid or elemental of your choosing; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures, nor can the creature being targeted by this spell influence the new form assumed [apart from conveying its wishes, if any, to you verbally]. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, the spell functions as beast shape II. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as elemental body I. If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as alter self. The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject.
Polymorph (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as polymorph except that it allows the creature to take on the form of a dragon or plant creature. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, it functions as beast shape IV. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as elemental body III. If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as alter self. If the form is that of a plant, the spell functions as plant shape II. If the form is that of a dragon, the spell functions as form of the dragon I. The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell.
Polymorph Any Object.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like greater polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another. You can use this spell to transform all manner of objects and creatures into new forms-you aren't limited to transforming a living creature into another living form. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its transmuted state. The duration is determined by using the following guidelines. &nl;Changed Subject Is. &pipe; Increase to Duration Factor* &nl;Same kingdom [animal, vegetable, mineral] &pipe; +5 &nl;Same class [mammals, fungi, metals, etc.] &pipe; +2 &nl;Changed Subject Is. &pipe; Increase to Duration Factor* &nl;Same size &pipe; +2 &nl;Related [twig is to tree, wolf fur is to wolf, etc.] &pipe; +2 &nl;Same or lower Intelligence &pipe; +2 &nl;*Add all that apply. Look up the total on the next table. &nl;Duration Factor Duration Example &nl;0 &pipe; 20 minutes &pipe; Pebble to human &nl;2 &pipe; 1 hour &pipe; Marionette to human &nl;4 &pipe; 3 hours &pipe; Human to marionette &nl;5 &pipe; 12 hours &pipe; Lizard to manticore &nl;6 &pipe; 2 days &pipe; Sheep to wool coat &nl;7 &pipe; 1 week &pipe; Shrew to manticore &nl;9+ Permanent Manticore to shrew &nl;If the target of the spell does not have physical ability scores [Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution], this spell grants a base score of 10 to each missing ability score. If the target of the spell does not have mental ability scores [Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma], this spell grants a score of 5 to such scores. Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force. A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren't affected by this spell. This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures. This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of baleful polymorph, greater polymorph, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute metal to wood, or transmute rock to mud.
Power Word Blind.MOD	DESC:You utter a single word of power that causes a creature to become blinded, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The duration of the spell depends on the target's current hit point total. Any creature that currently has 201 or more hit points is unaffected. &nl;Hit Points &pipe; Duration &nl;50 or less &pipe; Permanent &nl;51-100 &pipe; 1d4+1 minutes &nl;101-200 &pipe; 1d4+1 rounds
Power Word Kill.MOD	DESC:You utter a single word of power that instantly kills one creature of your choice, whether the creature can hear the word or not. Any creature that currently has 101 or more hit points is unaffected by power word kill.
Power Word Stun.MOD	DESC:You utter a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of your choice to become stunned, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The duration of the spell depends on the target's current hit point total. Any creature that currently has 151 or more hit points is unaffected by power word stun. &nl;Hit Points &pipe; Duration &nl;50 or less &pipe; 4d4 rounds &nl;51-100 &pipe; 2d4 rounds &nl;101-150 &pipe; 1d4 rounds
Prayer.MOD	DESC:You bring special favor upon yourself and your allies while bringing disfavor to your enemies. You and each of your allies gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks, while each of your foes takes a -1 penalty on such rolls.
Prestidigitation.MOD	DESC:Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object [beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it] persists only 1 hour.
Prismatic Sphere.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like prismatic wall, except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum. The sphere's blindness effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4 ? 10 minutes. You can pass into and out of the prismatic sphere and remain near it without harm. When you're inside it, however, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere [including spells]. Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time. Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe exists, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually occluded by the floor surface you are standing on. The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a prismatic wall. Prismatic sphere can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Prismatic Spray.MOD	DESC:This spell causes seven shimmering, multicolored beams of light to spray from your hand. Each beam has a different power. Creatures in the area of the spell with 8 HD or less are automatically blinded for 2d4 rounds. Every creature in the area is randomly struck by one or more beams, which have additional effects. &nl;1d8 Color of Beam &nl;1 Red &nl; 20 points fire damage [Reflex half] &nl;2 Orange &nl; 40 points acid damage [Reflex half] &nl;3 Yellow &nl; 80 points electricity damage [Reflex half] &nl;4 Green &nl; Poison [Frequency 1/rd. for 6 rd.; Init. effect death; Sec. effect 1 Con/rd.; Cure 2 consecutive Fort saves]* &nl;5 Blue &nl; Flesh to stone [Fortitude negates] &nl;6 Indigo &nl; Insane, as insanity spell [Will negates] &nl;7 Violet &nl; Sent to another plane [Will negates] &nl;8 Struck by two rays &nl; Roll twice more, ignoring any "8" results &nl;* See poisons.
Prismatic Wall.MOD	DESC:Prismatic wall creates a vertical, opaque wall-a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. Any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded by the colors for 2d4 rounds if it looks at the wall. The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted. Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color. The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by casting the specified spells on the wall; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a mage's disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic can only be used on the wall once all the other colors have been destroyed. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present. Prismatic wall can be made permanent with a permanency spell. [Table Not Included]
Produce Flame.MOD	DESC:Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment. In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies. You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 point per caster level [maximum +5]. Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack [with no range penalty] and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves. This spell does not function underwater.
Programmed Image.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like silent image, except that this spell's figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech. You set the triggering condition [which may be a special word] when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. See magic mouth for more details about such triggers.
Project Image.MOD	DESC:You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasireal, illusory version of yourself. The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics your actions [including speech] unless you direct it to act differently [which is a move action]. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened. If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you. The projected image can't cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image. Objects are affected by the projected image as if they had succeeded on their Will save. You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use dimension door, teleport, plane shift, or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.
Protection from Arrows.MOD	DESC:The warded creature gains resistance to ranged weapons. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons. This spell doesn't grant you the ability to damage creatures with similar damage reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level [maximum 100 points], it is discharged.
Protection from Chaos.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by chaotic creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against control by chaotic creatures and chaotic summoned creatures cannot touch the target.
Protection from Energy.MOD	DESC:Protection from energy grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast it [acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic]. When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage [to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level], it is discharged. Protection from energy overlaps [and does not stack with] resist energy. If a character is warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.
Protection from Evil.MOD	DESC:This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw [if one was allowed to begin with] against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature [including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects]. This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force [such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar], but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.
Protection from Good.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by good creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against control by good creatures and good summoned creatures cannot touch the target.
Protection from Law.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by lawful creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against control by lawful creatures and lawful summoned creatures cannot touch the target.
Protection from Spells.MOD	DESC:The subject gains a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities [but not against supernatural and extraordinary abilities].
Prying Eyes.MOD	DESC:You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs [called "eyes"] equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet [normal vision only] in all directions. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 [+8 bonus for its size], flies at a speed of 30 feet with a +20 bonus on Fly skill checks and a +16 bonus on Stealth skill checks. It has a Perception modifier equal to your caster level [maximum +15] and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling in darkness must find its way by touch. When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than 25 words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. Dispel magic can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.
Prying Eyes (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like prying eyes, except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had true seeing with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at normal speed. Also, a greater prying eye's maximum Perception modifier is +25 instead of +15.
Purify Food and Drink.MOD	DESC:This spell makes spoiled, rotten, diseased, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.
Pyrotechnics.MOD	DESC:Pyrotechnics turns a fire into a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on your choice. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level. Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds [Will negates]. These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness. Smoke Cloud: A stream of smoke billows out from the fire, forming a choking cloud that spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take -4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity [Fortitude negates]. These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.
Quench.MOD	DESC:Quench is often used to put out forest fires and other conflagrations. It extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. The spell also dispels any fire spells in its area, though you must succeed on a dispel check [1d20 +1 per caster level, maximum +15] against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell. Each creature with the fire subtype within the area of a quench spell takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 10d6, no save allowed]. Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame. The item loses all its fire-based magical abilities for 1d4 hours unless it succeeds on a Will save. Artifacts are immune to this effect.

#Block: R
Rage.MOD	DESC:Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. The effect is otherwise identical with a barbarian's rage except that the subjects aren't fatigued at the end of the rage.
Rainbow Pattern.MOD	DESC:A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those within it. Rainbow pattern fascinates a maximum of 24 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern. With a simple gesture [a free action], you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round [moving its effective point of origin]. All fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to remain within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area, each fascinated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked, creatures who can't see them are no longer affected. The spell does not affect sightless creatures.
Raise Dead.MOD	DESC:You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than 1 day per caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead [if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be raised]. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50%% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells [such as a sorcerer] has a 50%% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell. A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell. A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.
Ray of Enfeeblement.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels [maximum 1d6+5]. The subject's Strength score cannot drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.
Ray of Exhaustion.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The subject is immediately exhausted for the spell's duration. A successful Fortitude save means the creature is only fatigued. A character that is already fatigued instead becomes exhausted. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
Ray of Frost.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:A ray of freezing air and ice projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d3 points of cold damage.
Read Magic.MOD	DESC:You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects-books, scrolls, weapons, and the like-that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page [250 words] per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check [DC 10 + spell level]. Read magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Reduce Animal.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like reduce person, except that it affects a single willing animal. Reduce the damage dealt by the animal's natural attacks as appropriate for its new size [see Equipment how to adjust damage for size].
Reduce Person.MOD	DESC:This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a -2 size penalty to Strength [to a minimum of 1], and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size. A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet [meaning that it must enter an opponent's square to attack]. A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn't change the target's speed. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any reduced item that leaves the reduced creature's possession [including a projectile or thrown weapon] instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage [projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them]. Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack. Reduce person counters and dispels enlarge person. Reduce person can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Reduce Person (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like reduce person, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Refuge.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you create powerful magic in a specially prepared object. This object contains the power to instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is so enhanced, you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item [a standard action]. When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying [to a maximum of the character's heavy load] are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected [aside from a familiar or animal companion that is touching the subject]. You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the refuge spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.
Regenerate.MOD	DESC:The subject's severed body members [fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures], broken bones, and ruined organs grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise. Regenerate also cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +35], rids the subject of exhaustion and fatigue, and eliminates all nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures [including undead].
Reincarnate.MOD	DESC:With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated. A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments [since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race] and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead [if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated]. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50%% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells [such as a sorcerer] has a 50%% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell. It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character. For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table below. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created. A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age. [d%% Incarnation Str Dex Con]; [01 Bugbear +4 +2 +2]; [02-13 Dwarf +0 +0 +2]; [14-25 Elf +0 +2 -2]; [26 Gnoll +4 +0 +2]; [27-38 Gnome -2 +0 +2]; [39-42 Goblin -2 +2 +0]; [43-52 Half-elf +0 +2 +0]; [53-62 Half-orc +2 +0 +0]; [63-74 Halfling -2 +2 +0]; [75-89 Human +0 +0 +2]; [90-93 Kobold -4 +2 -2]; [94 Lizardfolk +2 +0 +2]; [95-98 Orc +4 +0 +0]; [99 Troglodyte +0 -2 +4]; [100 Other [GM's choice] ? ? ?]; The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form. A wish or a miracle spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.
Remove Blindness/Deafness.MOD	DESC:Remove blindness/deafness cures blindness or deafness [your choice], whether the effect is normal or magical in nature. The spell does not restore ears or eyes that have been lost, but it repairs them if they are damaged. Remove blindness/deafness counters and dispels blindness/deafness.
Remove Curse.MOD	DESC:Remove curse can remove all curses on an object or a creature. If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check [1d20 + caster level] against the DC of each curse affecting the target. Success means that the curse is removed. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although a successful caster level check enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Remove curse counters and dispels bestow curse.
Remove Disease.MOD	DESC:Remove disease can cure all diseases from which the subject is suffering. You must make a caster level check [1d20 + caster level] against the DC of each disease affecting the target. Success means that the disease is cured. The spell also kills some hazards and parasites, including green slime and others. Since the spell's duration is instantaneous, it does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease at a later date.
Remove Fear.MOD	DESC:You instill courage in the subject, granting it a +4 morale bonus against fear effects for 10 minutes. If the subject is under the influence of a fear effect when receiving the spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the spell. Remove fear counters and dispels cause fear.
Remove Paralysis.MOD	DESC:You can free one or more creatures from the effects of temporary paralysis or related magic, including spells and effects that cause a creature to gain the staggered condition. If the spell is cast on one creature, the paralysis is negated. If cast on two creatures, each receives another save with a +4 resistance bonus against the effect that afflicts it. If cast on three or four creatures, each receives another save with a +2 resistance bonus. The spell does not restore ability scores reduced by penalties, damage, or drain.
Repel Metal or Stone.MOD	DESC:This spell creates waves of invisible energy that roll forth from you. All metal or stone objects in the path of the spell are pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Fixed metal or stone objects larger than 3 inches in diameter and loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. Anything else, including animated objects, small boulders, and creatures in metal armor, moves back. Fixed objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller bend or break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round. Objects such as metal armor, swords, and the like are pushed back, dragging their bearers with them. Even magic items with metal components are repelled, although an antimagic field blocks the effects. A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action and drop it as a free action. The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power.
Repel Vermin.MOD	DESC:An invisible barrier holds back vermin. A vermin with HD of less than one-third your level cannot penetrate the barrier. A vermin with HD of one-third your level or more can penetrate the barrier if it succeeds on a Will save. Even so, crossing the barrier deals the vermin 2d6 points of damage, and pressing against the barrier causes pain, which deters most vermin.
Repel Wood.MOD	DESC:Waves of energy roll forth from you, moving in the direction that you determine, causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Wooden objects larger than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects are. Objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller that are fixed in place splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round. Objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them along. A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action and drop it as a free action. If a spear is planted [set] in a way that prevents this forced movement, it splinters. Even magic items with wooden sections are repelled, although an antimagic field blocks the effects. The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power.
Repulsion.MOD	DESC:An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting [to the limit your level allows]. Any creature within or entering the field must attempt a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move toward you for the duration of the spell. Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to an affected creature, nothing happens. The creature is not forced back. The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell's area.
Resilient Sphere.MOD	DESC:A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere functions as a wall of force, except that it can be negated by dispel magic. A subject inside the sphere can breathe normally. The sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.
Resistance.MOD	DESC:You imbue the subject with magical energy that protects it from harm, granting it a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Resistance can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Resist Energy.MOD	DESC:This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains resist energy 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage [whether from a natural or magical source], that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. Resist energy absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects. Resist energy overlaps [and does not stack with] protection from energy. If a character is warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.
Restoration.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser restoration, except that it also dispels temporary negative levels or one permanent negative level. If this spell is used to dispel a permanent negative level, it has a material component of diamond dust worth 1,000 gp. This spell cannot be used to dispel more than one permanent negative level possessed by a target in a 1-week period. Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score [your choice if more than one is drained]. It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.
Restoration (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser restoration, except that it dispels all permanent and temporary negative levels afflicting the healed creature. Greater restoration also dispels all magical effects penalizing the creature's abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all forms of insanity, confusion, and similar mental effects.
Restoration (Lesser).MOD	DESC:Lesser restoration dispels any magical effects reducing one of the subject's ability scores or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to one of the subject's ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the character, and improves an exhausted condition to fatigued. It does not restore permanent ability drain.
Resurrection.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like raise dead, except that you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. [The remains of a creature hit by a disintegrate spell count as a small portion of its body.] The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level. Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. The subject of the spell gains one permanent negative level when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead [if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be resurrected]. You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be resurrected.
Reverse Gravity.MOD	DESC:This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing unattached objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If a solid object [such as a ceiling] is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward. Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself when the spell strikes. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling.
Righteous Might.MOD	DESC:Your height immediately doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You gain a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution and take a -2 penalty to your Dexterity. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your natural armor. You gain DR 5/evil [if you normally channel positive energy] or DR 5/good [if you normally channel negative energy]. At 15th level, this DR becomes 10/evil or 10/good [the maximum]. Your size modifier for AC and attacks changes as appropriate to your new size category. This spell doesn't change your speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate to your new size. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check [using your increased Strength] to burst any enclosures in the process [see Additional Rules for rules on breaking objects]. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you-the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size. All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession [including a projectile or thrown weapon] instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical effects that increase size do not stack.
Rope Trick.MOD	DESC:When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the usual multiverse of extradimensional spaces. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells [including divinations], unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures [of any size]. The rope cannot be removed or hidden. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.
Rusting Grasp.MOD	DESC:Any iron or iron alloy item you touch crumbles into rust. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell. You may employ rusting grasp in combat with a successful melee touch attack. Rusting grasp used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of AC gained from metal armor [to the maximum amount of protection the armor offers] through corrosion. Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. Striking at an opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around. Against a ferrous creature, rusting grasp instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage + 1 per caster level [maximum +15] per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.

#Block: S
Sanctuary.MOD	DESC:Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.
Scare.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like cause fear, except that it causes all targeted creatures of less than 6 HD to become frightened.
Scintillating Pattern.MOD	DESC:A twisting pattern of coruscating colors weaves through the air, affecting creatures within. The spell affects a total number of HD of creatures equal to your caster level [maximum 20]. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first, and among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects each subject according to its HD. 6 or less: Unconscious for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then confused for 1d4 rounds. [Treat an unconscious result as stunned for nonliving creatures.] 7 to 12: Stunned for 1d4 rounds, then confused for an additional 1d4 rounds. 13 or more: Confused for 1d4 rounds. Sightless creatures are not affected by scintillating pattern.
Scorching Ray.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:You blast your enemies with a searing beam of fire. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd [to a maximum of three rays at 11th level]. Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.
Screen.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a powerful protection from scrying and observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. Direct observation may allow a save [as per a normal illusion], if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.
Scrying.MOD	DESC:You can observe a creature at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the spell fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection [if any] you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save. [Knowledge Will Save Modifier]; [None* +10]; [Secondhand [you have heard of the subject] +5]; [Firsthand [you have met the subject] +0]; [Familiar [you know the subject well] -5]; [Connection Will Save Modifier]; [Likeness or picture -2]; [Possession or garment -4]; [Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. -10]; [*You must have some sort of connection [see below] to a creature of which you have no knowledge.]; If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its surroundings [approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject]. If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet. As with all divination [scrying] spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5%% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message. If the save succeeds, you can't attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours.
Scrying (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like scrying, except as noted above. Additionally, all of the following spells function reliably through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, message, read magic, and tongues.
Sculpt Sound.MOD	DESC:You can change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can create sounds where none exist, deaden sounds, or transform sounds into other sounds. All affected creatures or objects must be transmuted in the same way. Once the transmutation is made, you cannot change it. You can change the qualities of sounds but cannot create words with which you are unfamiliar yourself. A spellcaster whose voice is changed dramatically is unable to cast spells with verbal components.
Searing Light.MOD	TYPE:Ray	DESC:Focusing divine power like a ray of the sun, you project a blast of light from your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A creature struck by this ray of light takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d8]. An undead creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 10d6], and an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright light takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level [maximum 10d8]. A construct or inanimate object takes only 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d6].
Secret Chest.MOD	DESC:You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as 60 days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level [regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet]. If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75%% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating [a standard action], and it appears next to you. The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica [of the same materials and perfect in every detail] so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. [The replica costs 50 gp.] The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be. To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5%% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it. Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.
Secret Page.MOD	DESC:Secret page alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster. This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. Explosive runes or sepia snake sigil can be cast upon the secret page. A comprehend languages spell alone cannot reveal a secret page's contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page and return it to its secret page form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A detect magic spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. True seeing reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with comprehend languages. A secret page spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an erase spell.
Secure Shelter.MOD	DESC:You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. The lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace. The shelter must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise-it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles [but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants]. The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being secured with arcane lock and the latter by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter. The secure shelter contains crude furnishings-eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.
See Invisibility.MOD	DESC:You can see any objects or beings that are invisible within your range of vision, as well as any that are ethereal, as if they were normally visible. Such creatures are visible to you as translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures. The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see. See invisibility can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Seeming.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like disguise self, except that you can change the appearance of other people as well. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making Will saves or with spell resistance.
Sending.MOD	DESC:You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence. Even if the sending is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner. If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5%% chance that the sending does not arrive. [Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.]
Sepia Snake Sigil.MOD	DESC:You cause a small symbol to appear in the text of a written work. The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake sigil springs into being, transforming into a large sepia serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader. Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed. While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces [and perhaps even killed], since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends. The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove the sigil. An erase spell destroys the entire page of text. Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as secret page.
Sequester.MOD	DESC:When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or locating the target and also renders the affected target invisible [as the invisibility spell]. The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by sequester become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends. Note: The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being sequestered. There is no save to see the sequestered creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.
Shades.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like shadow conjuration, except that it mimics conjuration spells of 8th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal four-fifths [80%%] damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 80%% likely to work against nonbelievers.
Shadow Conjuration.MOD	DESC:You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasireal illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration [summoning] or conjuration [creation] spell of 3rd level or lower. Shadow conjurations are only one-fifth [20%%] as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature that interacts with the spell can make a Will save to recognize its true nature. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth [20%%] damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20%% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration's level [4th] rather than the spell's normal level. In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are 20%% likely to work. A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind [regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy]. It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth [20%%] normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20%% likely to work. [Roll for each use and each affected character separately.] Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are just onefifth as large. A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.
Shadow Conjuration (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like shadow conjuration, except that it duplicates any sorcerer or wizard conjuration [summoning] or conjuration [creation] spell of 6th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal three-fifths [60%%] damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 60%% likely to work against nonbelievers.
Shadow Evocation.MOD	DESC:You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasireal, illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong [if applicable] or only 20%% likely to occur. If recognized as a shadow evocation, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth [20%%] damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save [or spell resistance] that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow evocation's level [5th] rather than the spell's normal level. Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.
Shadow Evocation (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like shadow evocation, except that it enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation spells of 7th level or lower. If recognized as a greater shadow evocation, a damaging spell deals only three-fifths [60%%] damage.
Shadow Walk.MOD	DESC:To use the shadow walk spell, you must be in an area of dim light. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you [subject to your level limit], but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 ? 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 ? 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you [and any creatures with you] are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued [no save]. Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane [50%% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you]. Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.
Shambler.MOD	DESC:The shambler spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with the advanced template. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for 7 days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is 7 months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared. You can only have one shambler spell in effect at one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. The shamblers have resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain where they are summoned is rainy, marshy, or damp.
Shapechange.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to take the form of a wide variety of creatures. This spell can function as alter self, beast form IV, elemental body IV, form of the dragon III, giant form II, and plant shape III depending on what form you take. You can change form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action.
Shatter.MOD	DESC:Shatter creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature. Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered. Alternatively, you can target shatter against a single solid nonmagical object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature [of any weight], shatter deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level [maximum 10d6], with a Fortitude save for half damage.
Shield.MOD	DESC:Shield creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front of you. It negates magic missile attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The shield has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.
Shield of Faith.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a shimmering, magical field around the target that averts and deflects attacks. The spell grants the subject a +2 deflection bonus to AC, with an additional +1 to the bonus for every six levels you have [maximum +5 deflection bonus at 18th level].
Shield of Law.MOD	DESC:A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and slowing chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike protection from chaos, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures. Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures. Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental influence, just as protection from chaos does. Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is slowed [Will save negates, as the slow spell, but against shield of law's save DC].
Shield Other.MOD	DESC:This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks [including those dealt by special abilities] that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject. If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.
Shillelagh.MOD	DESC:Your own nonmagical club or quarterstaff becomes a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A quarterstaff gains this enhancement for both ends of the weapon. It deals damage as if it were two size categories larger [a Small club or quarterstaff so transmuted deals 1d8 points of damage, a Medium 2d6, and a Large 3d6], +1 for its enhancement bonus. These effects only occur when the weapon is wielded by you. If you do not wield it, the weapon behaves as if unaffected by this spell.
Shocking Grasp.MOD	DESC:Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level [maximum 5d6]. When delivering the jolt, you gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the opponent is wearing metal armor [or is carrying a metal weapon or is made of metal].
Shout.MOD	DESC:You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level [maximum 15d6]. An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful Reflex save. A shout spell cannot penetrate a silence spell.
Shout (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like shout, except that the cone deals 10d6 points of sonic damage [or 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level, maximum 20d6, against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures]. It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. A creature in the area of the cone can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and the duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save. A creature holding vulnerable objects can attempt a Reflex save to negate the damage to those objects.
Shrink Item.MOD	DESC:You are able to shrink one nonmagical item [if it is within the size limit] to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension [to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass]. This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a shrink item spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell. Shrink item can be made permanent with a permanency spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.
Silence.MOD	DESC:Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area of a silence spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, and effects.
Silent Image.MOD	DESC:This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.
Simulacrum.MOD	DESC:Simulacrum creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half of the real creature's levels or HD [and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD]. You can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Perception check [opposed by the caster's Disguise check] or a DC 20 Sense Motive check. At all times, the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to a simulacrum.
Slay Living.MOD	DESC:You can attempt to slay any one living creature. When you cast this spell, your hand seethes with eerie dark fire. You must succeed on a melee touch attack to touch the target. The target takes 12d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.
Sleep.MOD	DESC:A sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action [an application of the aid another action]. Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.
Sleet Storm.MOD	DESC:Driving sleet blocks all sight [even darkvision] within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls [see the Acrobatics skill for details]. The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.
Slow.MOD	DESC:slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both [nor may it take full-round actions]. Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed [round down to the next 5-foot increment], which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed. Multiple slow effects don't stack. Slow counters and dispels haste.
Snare.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings [DC 23 Perception check for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate]. One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle. If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled. The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.
Soften Earth and Stone.MOD	DESC:When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell's area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected. A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. While this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls [treat as a cave-in with no bury zone, see Environment]. A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.
Solid Fog.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like fog cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a solid fog move at half their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks [except for magic rays and the like]. A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in solid fog. Solid fog, and effects that work like solid fog, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties. Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind [31+ mph] disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round. Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
Song of Discord.MOD	DESC:This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50%% chance to attack the nearest target each round. [Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.] A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. Creatures forced by a song of discord to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen unconscious.
Soul Bind.MOD	DESC:You draw the soul from a newly dead body and imprison it in a black sapphire gem. The subject must have been dead no more than 1 round per caster level. The soul, once trapped in the gem, cannot be returned through clone, raise dead, reincarnation, resurrection, true resurrection, or even a miracle or a wish. Only by destroying the gem or dispelling the spell on the gem can one free the soul [which is then still dead]. The focus for this spell is a black sapphire of at least 1,000 gp value for every HD possessed by the creature whose soul is to be bound. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the binding is attempted. [While creatures have no concept of level or HD as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched.]
Sound Burst.MOD	DESC:You blast an area with a tremendous cacophony. Every creature in the area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. Creatures that cannot hear are not stunned but are still damaged.
Speak with Animals.MOD	DESC:You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but the spell doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.
Speak with Dead.MOD	DESC:You grant the semblance of life to a corpse, allowing it to answer questions. You may ask one question per two caster levels. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed you in life. If the dead creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive. If successful, the corpse can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you, using Bluff. The soul can only speak about what it knew in life. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after its death. If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.
Speak with Plants.MOD	DESC:You can communicate with normal plants and plant creatures, and can ask questions of and receive answers from them. A normal plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give [or recognize] detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature is friendly, it may do some favor or service for you.
Spectral Hand.MOD	DESC:A ghostly hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends [even if it is dispelled], but not if the hand is destroyed. [The hit points can be healed as normal.] For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if it goes beyond the spell range or goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers. The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion [half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save], your save bonuses, and an AC of 22 [+8 size, +4 natural armor]. Your Intelligence modifier applies to the hand's AC as if it were the hand's Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it.
Spell Immunity.MOD	DESC:The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which spell resistance doesn't apply. Spell immunity protects against spells, spelllike effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. A creature can have only one spell immunity or greater spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time.
Spell Immunity (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like spell immunity, except the immunity applies to spells of 8th level or lower. A creature can have only one spell immunity or greater spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time.
Spell Resistance.MOD	DESC:The target gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your caster level.
Spell Turning.MOD	DESC:Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells. From seven to ten [1d4+6] spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is rolled secretly. When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. Subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be the one who is affected. If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by spell turning effects in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll randomly to determine the result. [d%% Effect]; [01-70 Spell drains away without effect.]; [71-80 Spell affects both of you equally at full effect.]; [81-97 Both turning effects are rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 minutes.]; [98-100 Both of you go through a rift into another plane.]
Spellstaff.MOD	DESC:You store one spell that you can normally cast in a wooden quarterstaff. Only one such spell can be stored in a staff at a given time, and you cannot have more than one spellstaff at any given time. You can cast a spell stored within a staff just as though it were among those you had prepared, but it does not count against your normal allotment for a given day. You use up any applicable material components required to cast the spell when you store it in the spellstaff.
Spider Climb.MOD	DESC:The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface [even upside down]. A spider climbing creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class [if any] while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.
Spike Growth.MOD	DESC:Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance. In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, spike growth can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area. Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its land speed by half. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a cure spell [which also restores lost hit points]. Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC. Magic traps are hard to detect. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a spike growth. The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 28 for spike growth [or DC 27 for spike growth cast by a ranger]. Spike growth can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.
Spike Stones.MOD	DESC:Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shape themselves into long, sharp points that blend into the background. Spike stones impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area moves at half speed. In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area. Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a cure spell [which also restores lost hit points]. Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC. Magic traps such as spike stones are hard to detect. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find spike stones. The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 29 for spike stones. Spike stones is a magic trap that can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.
Spiritual Weapon.MOD	DESC:A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels [maximum +5 at 15th level]. The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you [see below] and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus [possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds] plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action. A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 [10 + size bonus for Tiny object]. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check [1d20 + caster level] against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos [battleaxe], evil [light flail], good [warhammer], law [longsword].
Stabilize.MOD	DESC:Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has - 1 or fewer hit points. That creature is automatically stabilized and does not lose any further hit points. If the creature later takes damage, it continues dying normally.
Statue.MOD	DESC:A statue spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. In statue form, the subject gains hardness 8. The subject retains its own hit points. The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body. Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue's arms constitutes serious damage. The subject of a statue spell can return to its normal state, act, and then return instantly to the statue state [a free action] if it so desires as long as the spell duration is in effect.
Status.MOD	DESC:When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, status allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned, diseased, confused, or the like. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it.
Stinking Cloud.MOD	DESC:Stinking cloud creates a bank of fog like that created by fog cloud, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. [Roll separately for each nauseated character.] Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. Stinking cloud can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent stinking cloud dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
Stone Shape.MOD	DESC:You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with stone shape, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30%% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.
Stone Tell.MOD	DESC:You gain the ability to speak with stones, which relate to you who or what has touched them as well as revealing what is covered or concealed behind or under them. The stones relate complete descriptions if asked. A stone's perspective, perception, and knowledge may prevent the stone from providing the details you are looking for. You can speak with natural or worked stone.
Stone to Flesh.MOD	DESC:This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored. The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. For example, this spell would turn an animated stone statue into an animated flesh statue, but an ordinary statue would become a mass of inert flesh in the shape of the statue. You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.
Stoneskin.MOD	DESC:The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains DR 10/adamantine. It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level [maximum 150 points], it is discharged.
Storm of Vengeance.MOD	DESC:You create a huge black storm cloud in the air. Each creature under the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 ? 10 minutes. Each round you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects as noted below. Each effect occurs on your turn. 2nd Round: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage [no save]. 3rd Round: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may be directed at the same target. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. A creature struck can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. 4th Round: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage [no save]. 5th through 10th Rounds: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment [attacks have a 20%% miss chance]. Creatures farther away have total concealment [50%% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target]. Speed is reduced by three-quarters. Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the storm of vengeance's save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.
Suggestion.MOD	DESC:You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity [limited to a sentence or two]. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed. A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty [such as -1 or -2].
Suggestion (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like suggestion, except that it can affect more creatures. The same suggestion applies to all these creatures.
Summon Instrument.MOD	DESC:This spell summons one handheld musical instrument of your choice. This instrument appears in your hands or at your feet [your choice]. The instrument is typical for its type. Only one instrument appears per casting, and it will play only for you. You can't summon an instrument too large to be held in two hands. The summoned instrument disappears at the end of this spell.
Summon Monster I.MOD	DESC:This spell summons an extraplanar creature [typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane]. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10-5. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell. A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components [such as wish]. When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10-5 marked with an "*" are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an "*" always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment. [Table Not Included]
Summon Monster II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list.
Summon Monster III.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list.
Summon Monster IV.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Monster V.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Monster VI.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Monster VII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Monster VIII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Monster IX.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Nature's Ally I.MOD	DESC:This spell summons to your side a natural creature [typically an animal, fey, magical beast, outsider with the elemental subtype, or a giant]. The summoned ally appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions as you command. A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that have expensive material components [such as wish]. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10-6. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted. When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. All creatures summoned with this spell without alignment subtypes have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment. [Chart not included]
Summon Nature's Ally II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as summon nature's ally I, except that you summon one 2nd-level creature or 1d3 1st-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally III.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 3rd-level creature, 1d3 2nd-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 1st-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally IV.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 4th-level creature, 1d3 3rd-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally V.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 5th-level creature, 1d3 4th-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally VI.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 6th-level creature, 1d3 5th-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally VII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 7th-level creature, 1d3 6th-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally VIII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 8th-level creature, 1d3 7th-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally IX.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 9th-level creature, 1d3 8th-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Swarm.MOD	DESC:You summon a swarm of bats, rats, or spiders [your choice], which attacks all other creatures within its area. [You may summon the swarm so that it shares the area of other creatures.] If no living creatures are within its area, the swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best it can. The caster has no control over its target or direction of travel.
Sunbeam.MOD	DESC:For the duration of this spell, you can use a standard action to evoke a dazzling beam of intense light each round. You can call forth one beam per three caster levels [maximum six beams at 18th level]. The spell ends when its duration runs out or your allotment of beams is exhausted. Each creature in the beam is blinded and takes 4d6 points of damage. Any creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take double damage. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half. An undead creature caught within the beam takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 20d6], or half damage if a Reflex save is successful. In addition, the beam results in the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its save. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures.
Sunburst.MOD	DESC:Sunburst causes a globe of searing radiance to explode silently from a point you select. All creatures in the globe are blinded and take 6d6 points of damage. A creature to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural takes double damage. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half. An undead creature caught within the globe takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 25d6], or half damage if a Reflex save is successful. In addition, the burst results in the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its save. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures. Sunburst dispels any darkness spells of lower than 9th level within its area.
Symbol of Death.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol [treat as a burst] whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again. Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive [though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet]. To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally. As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it [even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune]. Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed. In this case, "reading" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify. When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again. You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group [as many as 10 creatures] extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group [as many as 25 creatures] takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them. Read magic allows you to identify a symbol with a Spellcraft check [DC 10 + the symbol's spell level]. Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol. A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it. Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death
Symbol of Fear.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within 60 feet of the symbol of fear instead become panicked for 1 round per caster level. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of fear are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of fear and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for symbol of fear.
Symbol of Insanity.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of the symbol of insanity instead become permanently insane [as the insanity spell]. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of insanity has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of insanity simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of insanity are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of insanity and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of insanity.
Symbol of Pain.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like symbol of death, except that each creature within the radius of a symbol of pain instead suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of pain has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of pain simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of pain are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of pain and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of pain.
Symbol of Persuasion.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of a symbol of persuasion instead become charmed by the caster [as the charm monster spell] for 1 hour per caster level. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of persuasion has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of persuasion simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of persuasion are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of persuasion and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for symbol of persuasion.
Symbol of Sleep.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the symbol of sleep instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 ? 10 minutes. Unlike with the sleep spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of sleep has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of sleep simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of sleep are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of sleep and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of sleep.
Symbol of Stunning.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within 60 feet of a symbol of stunning instead become stunned for 1d6 rounds. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of stunning are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of stunning and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for symbol of stunning.
Symbol of Weakness.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like symbol of death, except that every creature within 60 feet of a symbol of weakness instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of weakness has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of weakness simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of weakness are hard to detect and disable. A rogue [only] can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of weakness and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for symbol of weakness.
Sympathetic Vibration.MOD	DESC:By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure, you can create a damaging vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration deals 2d10 points of damage per round to the target structure, bypassing hardness. You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round per level. If the spell is cast upon a target that is not freestanding, the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and no damage occurs. Sympathetic vibration cannot affect creatures [including constructs]. Since a structure is an unattended object, it gets no saving throw to resist the effect.
Sympathy.MOD	DESC:You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named. Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 x 10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object. Sympathy counters and dispels antipathy.

#Block: T, U
Telekinesis.MOD	DESC:You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust. Sustained Force: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level [maximum 375 pounds at 15th level] up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks. Combat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple [including pin], or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier [if a wizard] or Charisma modifier [if a sorcerer] in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level [maximum 15] that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level [maximum 375 pounds at 15th level]. You must succeed on attack rolls [one per creature or object thrown] to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier [if a wizard] or Charisma modifier [if a sorcerer]. Weapons cause standard damage [with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner]. Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds [for less dangerous objects] to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds [for hard, dense objects]. Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target. Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves [and spell resistance] to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet [1d6 points].
Telekinetic Sphere.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like resilient sphere, but the creatures or objects caught inside the globe created by the spell are made nearly weightless. Anything contained within a telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range [100 feet + 10 feet per caster level] after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents. You can move the sphere, along with the objects and creatures it contains that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less, by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so [a standard action], you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round [if on a level surface] or descends at its falling rate [if aloft] until it reaches a level surface. You can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell's duration. The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere. You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.
Telepathic Bond.MOD	DESC:You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance [although not from one plane to another]. If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting. Telepathic bond can be made permanent with a permanency spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of permanency.
Teleport.MOD	DESC:This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature [carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load] or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use [attended] by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d%% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: "Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying. "False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. On Target: You appear where you want to be. Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d %% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll. [Table not included]
Teleport (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like teleport, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information [or with misleading information], you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.
Teleport Object.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like teleport, except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported. If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted dispel magic spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.
Teleportation Circle.MOD	DESC:You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as greater teleport, any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can't change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane. The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way. Teleportation circle can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent teleportation circle that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal. Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use the Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of teleportation circle.
Temporal Stasis.MOD	DESC:You must succeed on a melee touch attack. You place the subject into a state of suspended animation. For the creature, time ceases to flow, and its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it. This state persists until the magic is removed [such as by a successful dispel magic spell or a freedom spell].
Time Stop.MOD	DESC:This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the time stop is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the time stop have their normal effects on other creatures once the time stop ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat. You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession. You are undetectable while time stop lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an antimagic field while under the effect of time stop.
Tiny Hut.MOD	DESC:You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends. The temperature inside the hut is 70?F if the exterior temperature is between 0? and 100?F. An exterior temperature below 0? or above 100? lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane [75+ mph wind speed] or greater force destroys it. The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut [they have total concealment].
Tongues.MOD	DESC:This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. Tongues does not enable the subject to speak with creatures who don't speak. The subject can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way. Tongues can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Touch of Fatigue.MOD	DESC:You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target. The subject is immediately fatigued for the spell's duration. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued. Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
Touch of Idiocy.MOD	DESC:With a touch, you reduce the target's mental faculties. Your successful melee touch attack applies a 1d6 penalty to the target's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This penalty can't reduce any of these scores below 1. This spell's effect may make it impossible for the target to cast some or all of its spells, if the requisite ability score drops below the minimum required to cast spells of that level.
Transformation.MOD	DESC:You become a fighting machine-stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat. Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and you can't cast spells, even from magic items. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus to AC, a +5 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and proficiency with all simple and martial weapons. Your base attack bonus equals your character level [which may give you multiple attacks]. You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your class list.
Transmute Metal to Wood.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by creatures are affected as well. A magic object made of metal effectively has spell resistance equal to 20 + its caster level against this spell. Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to wood take a - 2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The armor bonus of any armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20. Only limited wish, miracle, wish, or similar magic can restore a transmuted object to its metallic state.
Transmute Mud to Rock.MOD	DESC:This spell permanently transforms normal mud or quicksand of any depth into soft stone [sandstone or a similar mineral]. Any creature in the mud is allowed a Reflex save to escape before the area is hardened to stone. Transmute mud to rock counters and dispels transmute rock to mud.
Transmute Rock to Mud.MOD	DESC:This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush or similar material thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet. If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the targeted area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves. Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell. The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance-but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage. Transmute rock to mud counters and dispels transmute mud to rock.
Transport via Plants.MOD	DESC:You can enter any normal plant [equal to your size or larger] and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The plants must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature [carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load] or its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: a Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported by the spell must be in physical contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. You can't use this spell to travel through plant creatures. The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from it.
Trap the Soul.MOD	DESC:Trap the soul forces a creature's life force [and its material body] into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane, it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways. Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance [if any] and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters. Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.
Tree Shape.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The exact type of tree, as well as its appearance, is completely under your control. Even the closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you. You can dismiss tree shape as a free action [instead of as a standard action].
Tree Stride.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to step into a tree, magically infusing yourself with the plant. Once within a tree, you can teleport from that particular tree to another tree. The trees you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree [for example], you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range [see below] and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table. [Type of Tree Transport Range]; [Oak, ash, yew 3,000 feet]; [Elm, linden 2,000 feet]; [Other deciduous 1,500 feet]; [Any coniferous 1,000 feet] You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level [passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree]. The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each transport is a full-round action. You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.
True Resurrection.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like raise dead, except that you can resurrect a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster level. This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion [reciting the deceased's time and place of birth or death is the most common method]. Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no negative levels [or Constitution points] and all of the prepared spells possessed by the creature when it died. You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect elementals or outsiders, but it can't resurrect constructs or undead creatures. Even true resurrection can't restore to life a creature who has died of old age.
True Seeing.MOD	DESC:You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane [but not into extradimensional spaces]. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet. True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.
True Strike.MOD	DESC:You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future during your next attack. Your next single attack roll [if it is made before the end of the next round] gains a +20 insight bonus. Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.
Undeath to Death.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like circle of death, except that it destroys undead creatures as noted above.
Undetectable Alignment.MOD	DESC:An undetectable alignment spell conceals the alignment of an object or a creature from all forms of divination.
Unhallow.MOD	DESC:Unhallow makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects. First, the site or structure is guarded by a magic circle against good effect. Second, the DC to resist negative channeled energy within the spell's area of effect gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to resist positive energy is reduced by 4. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell. Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site. The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again. Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. [See the individual spell descriptions for details.] An area can receive only one unhallow spell [and its associated spell effect] at a time. Unhallow counters but does not dispel hallow.
Unholy Aura.MOD	DESC:A malevolent darkness surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by good creatures, and weakening good creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of protection from good, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by good creatures. Second, a warded creature gains SR 25 against good spells and spells cast by good creatures. Third, the abjuration protects the subjects from possession and mental influence, just as protection from good does. Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of Strength damage [Fortitude negates].
Unholy Blight.MOD	DESC:You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness. Only good and neutral [not evil] creatures are harmed by the spell. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d8] to a good creature [or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider] and causes it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by remove disease or heal, but remove curse is effective. The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again [down to one-quarter] with a successful Will save.
Unseen Servant.MOD	DESC:An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 [so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds]. It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. This servant cannot fly, climb, or even swim [though it can walk on water]. Its base speed is 15 feet. The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. [It gets no saves against attacks.] If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range [measured from your current position], the servant ceases to exist.

#Block: V, W, Z
Vampiric Touch.MOD	DESC:You must succeed on a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 10d6]. You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain more than the subject's current hit points + the subject's Constitution score [which is enough to kill the subject]. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later.
Veil.MOD	DESC:You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain that appearance for the spell's duration. You can make the subjects appear to be anything you wish. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. You must succeed on a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus on the check. Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making Will saves or with spell resistance. Those who interact with the subjects can attempt Will disbelief saves to see through the glamer, but spell resistance doesn't help.
Ventriloquism.MOD	DESC:You can make your voice [or any sound that you can normally make vocally] seem to issue from someplace else. You can speak in any language you know. With respect to such voices and sounds, anyone who hears the sound and rolls a successful save recognizes it as illusory [but still hears it].
Virtue.MOD	DESC:With a touch, you infuse a creature with a tiny surge of life, granting the subject 1 temporary hit point.
Vision.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like legend lore, except that it works more quickly and produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some person, place, or object, then cast the spell. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster level check [1d20 + 1 per caster level; maximum +25] against DC 20. If only detailed information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information gained is vague. After this spell is complete, you are fatigued.
Wail of the Banshee.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you emit a terrible, soul-chilling scream that possibly kills creatures that hear it [except for yourself]. The spell affects up to one creature per caster level, inflicting 10 points of damage per caster level. Creatures closest to the point of origin are affected first.
Wall of Fire.MOD	DESC:An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears, and to all creatures in the area on your turn each round. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level [maximum +20] to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points or more of cold damage in 1 round, that length goes away. [Do not divide cold damage by 2, as normal for objects.] Wall of fire can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent wall of fire that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.
Wall of Force.MOD	DESC:A wall of force creates an invisible wall of pure force. The wall cannot move and is not easily destroyed. A wall of force is immune to dispel magic, although a mage's disjunction can still dispel it. A wall of force can be damaged by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys it. It can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but a wall of force has hardness 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a sphere of annihilation or rod of cancellation instantly destroys a wall of force. Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through a wall of force in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones [though ethereal creatures can usually circumvent the wall by going around it, through material floors and ceilings]. Gaze attacks can operate through a wall of force. The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails. Wall of force can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Wall of Ice.MOD	DESC:This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall [instead of the normal half damage taken by objects]. Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes. Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level [so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet]. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it [including the one who broke through the wall] takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level [no save]. Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.
Wall of Iron.MOD	DESC:You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space. A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness. If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50%% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures. Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. Iron created by this spell is not suitable for use in the creation of other objects and cannot be sold.
Wall of Stone.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness. It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.
Wall of Thorns.MOD	DESC:A wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. [Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.] You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier. Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet [up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed]. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage. A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.
Warp Wood.MOD	DESC:You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open [or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option]. A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a -4 penalty on attack rolls. You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32. Alternatively, you can unwarp wood [effectively warping it back to normal] with this spell. Make whole, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item. You can combine multiple consecutive warp wood spells to warp [or unwarp] an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.
Water Breathing.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures you touch. The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air.
Water Walk.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creatures can tread on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the subjects' feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Creatures crossing molten lava still take damage from the heat because they are near it. The subjects can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground. If the spell is cast underwater [or while the subjects are partially or wholly submerged in whatever liquid they are in], the subjects are borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round until they can stand on it.
Waves of Exhaustion.MOD	DESC:Waves of negative energy cause all living creatures in the spell's area to become exhausted. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted.
Waves of Fatigue.MOD	DESC:Waves of negative energy render all living creatures in the spell's area fatigued. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued.
Web.MOD	DESC:Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn't cause you to become grappled. Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell's DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter. If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover. The strands of a web spell are flammable. A flaming weapon can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent web that is damaged [but not destroyed] regrows in 10 minutes.
Weird.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like phantasmal killer, except it can affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes. If a subject's Fortitude save succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. The subject also takes 1d4 points of Strength damage.
Whirlwind.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. [You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.] Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.
Whispering Wind.MOD	DESC:You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.
Wind Walk.MOD	DESC:You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor [as the gaseous form spell] and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently. Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round [60 mph] with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80%% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like. A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell [as does any time spent in physical form]. As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others. For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round [for a total of 600 feet], though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.
Wind Wall.MOD	DESC:An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. [A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.] Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30%% miss chance. [A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.] Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall [although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures]. While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points.
Wish.MOD	DESC:Wish is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even wish, however, has its limits. A wish can produce any one of the following effects. . Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools. . Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools. . Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools. . Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools. . Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity. . Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score [two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three wishes for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on]. Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies. . Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. . Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes: one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from gaining a permanent negative level. . Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance [if any] applies. . Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round [including your last turn]. Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit [either the attack roll or the critical roll], a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance [if any] applies. You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. [The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the GM's discretion.] Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal [but save DCs are for 9th-level spells]. When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component [in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell].
Wood Shape.MOD	DESC:Wood shape enables you to form one existing piece of wood into any shape that suits your purpose. While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30%% chance that any shape that includes moving parts simply doesn't work.
Word of Chaos.MOD	DESC:Any nonchaotic creature within the area of a word of chaos spell suffers the following ill effects, depending on their HD. [HD Effect] [Equal to caster level Deafened]; [Up to caster level -1 Stunned, deafened]; [Up to caster level -5 Confused, stunned, deafened]; [Up to caster level -10 Killed, confused, stunned, deafened] The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects. Deafened: The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds. Save negates. Stunned: The creature is stunned for 1 round. Save negates. Confused: The creature is confused for 1d10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting enchantment effect. Save reduces the confused effect to 1 round. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +25]. Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the word of chaos or not. The banishment effect allows a Will save [at a -4 penalty] to negate. Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by word of chaos.
Word of Recall.MOD	DESC:Word of recall teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature [carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load] or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. An unwilling creature can't be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a creature's Will save [or spell resistance] prevents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.
Zone of Silence.MOD	DESC:By casting zone of silence, you manipulate sound waves in your immediate vicinity so that you and those within the spell's area can converse normally, yet no one outside can hear your voices or any other noises from within, including language-dependent or sonic spell effects. This effect is centered on you and moves with you. Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those who leave are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful DC 20 Linguistics check to read lips can still reveal what's said inside a zone of silence.
Zone of Truth.MOD	DESC:Creatures within the emanation area [or those who enter it] can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.

DESC:This spell summons an extraplanar creature [typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane]. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10-5. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell. A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components [such as wish]. When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10-5 marked with an "*" are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an "*" always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment. [Table Not Included]

#	Full Spell Descriptions	#

#################################################
#Block: A
# Spell Name	Description
Absorbing Touch.MOD	DESC:You absorb the next object your hand touches into your body. If you are already holding an object, you can attempt to absorb it; otherwise, you may touch an object as a standard action separate from casting the spell. You can absorb any nonmagical, nonliving object weighing no more than 1 pound per caster level. A container and its contents count as a single object. Objects in the possession of another creature receive a Fortitude saving throw to prevent absorption. You may continue to attempt to absorb objects until one is absorbed.  An absorbed object melds with your hand and cannot be targeted, but the object's weight still counts against your carrying capacity. If you dismiss the spell, the item appears in the hand that absorbed it, or falls to the ground if that hand is full. Multiple castings let you absorb additional items, but you can only store a single item per hand.
Accelerate Poison.MOD	DESC:You hasten the onset of poison in the target. If the poison normally has an onset time, its effects begin immediately. If the poison has no onset time, its frequency is doubled, requiring two saving throws and inflicting damage twice per round or minute, though its duration is halved. Accelerate poison does not change the cure condition for the poison. If the target is affected by more than one poison, you may choose which is affected if you administered the poison; otherwise, randomly determine which poison is affected.
Acid Pit.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as create pit, except that it places a 5-footdeep pool of acid at the bottom of the pit. The pit has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal (the acid counts as a yielding surface), plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round spent in contact with the acid. In addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit may be harmed. Refer to Table 9-2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks (Core Rulebook 216). Items are affected one at a time in the order listed on the table, and must make Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive rounds in the acid or gain the broken condition. Objects with the broken condition (regardless of how they became broken) must make a Fortitude saving throw each round spent within the acid or be destroyed. The walls of the pit are quite slippery and have a Climb DC of 30.
Alchemical Allocation.MOD	DESC:This extract causes a pale aura to emanate from your mouth.  If you consume a potion or elixir on the round following the consumption of this extract, you can spit it back into its container as a free action. You gain all the benefits of the potion or elixir, but it is not consumed. You can only gain the benefits of one potion or elixir in this way per use of this extract.
Allfood.MOD	DESC:You can transform one object, weighing up to 5 lbs. per caster level, into an edible substance that any living creature can chew, swallow, and safely digest. This allfood always has a bland taste and slightly gooey consistency when chewed regardless of its original nature.  One pound of allfood provides enough sustenance to support a Medium creature for an entire day.  Objects of similar nature in close proximity, such as a pile of rocks, count as a single object for the purpose of this spell. You cannot use this spell to transform objects with magical or other exceptional qualities. An object's hardness is considered to be 0 for the purposes of eating it, but it retains its normal hardness for all other situations, and becomes no more vulnerable to sunder attacks, break attempts, or any other action typically directed against objects. Objects such as hot coals or a burning torch continue to produce energy even after you transform them into allfood and if a creature attempts to eat such an object, it takes damage accordingly.
Alter Winds.MOD	DESC:You subtly enhance or diminish the effects of natural winds within the spell's area, which is an immobile emanation around a point touched by you as the spell is cast. Within the area, natural (but not magical) wind effects are either increased or decreased by one step in intensity (Core Rulebook 439). The maximum wind force you can affect with this spell is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below. Alter winds has no effect on magical wind effects.
Amplify Elixir.MOD	DESC:This extract greatly enhances the effects of any potion or elixir you consume. For the duration of this extract, any potion or elixir you consume is treated as if it were empowered. Increase all variable numeric effects of the potion or elixir by half. If the potion or elixir does not have any variable numeric effects, it is instead treated as if it were extended (double the duration of the potion or elixir). If the potion or elixir does not have any variable numeric effects, or has an instantaneous duration, amplify elixir has no effect. Amplify elixir affects oils that target you, but it has no effect on oils that target your equipment.
Ant Haul.MOD	DESC:The target's carrying capacity triples (see Table 7-4: Carrying Capacity on page 171 of the Core Rulebook). This does not affect the creature's actual Strength in any way, merely the amount of material it can carry while benefiting from this spell. It also has no effect on encumbrance due to armor. If the creature wears armor it still takes the normal penalties for doing so regardless of how much weight the spell allows it to carry.
Aqueous Orb.MOD	DESC:You create a rolling sphere of churning water that can engulf those it strikes. The aqueous orb can move up to 30 feet per round, rolling over barriers less than 10 feet tall. It automatically quenches any nonmagical fires and functions as dispel magic against magical fires as long as those fires are size Large or less.  Any creature in the path of the aqueous orb takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. A successful Reflex save negates this damage, but a Large or smaller creature that fails its save must make a second save or be engulfed by the aqueous orb and carried along with it. Engulfed creatures are immersed in water and must hold their breath unless capable of breathing water. They gain cover against attacks from outside the aqueous orb but are considered entangled by its churning currents, takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage at the beginning of their turn each round they remain trapped. Creatures within the orb may attempt a new Reflex save each round to escape into a random square adjacent to the aqueous orb. The orb may hold one Large creature, 4 Medium, or 16 Small or smaller creatures within it.  The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and churns in place. An aqueous orb stops if it moves outside the spell's range.
Arcane Concordance.MOD	DESC:A shimmering, blue and gold radiance surrounds you, enhancing arcane spells cast by your allies within its area. Any arcane spell cast by a creature within the area gains a +1 enhancement bonus to the DC of any saving throws against the spell, and can be cast as if one of the following metamagic feats was applied to it (without increasing the spell level or casting time): Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell (you choose the metamagic feat when you cast arcane concordance).
Arrow Eruption.MOD	DESC:You create exact duplicates of the arrow or crossbow bolt you used to kill a creature in the previous round and launch one at enemy creatures within a 30-foot radius of the corpse. You can target one creature per caster level (maximum 15) within range of the burst and must make a single attack roll and apply it to each arrow. These duplicate arrows possess all the intrinsic magical properties of the arrow that killed the original creature as well as those passed on to it by your bow. They also enjoy the full benefit of any bonuses or modifiers you applied to the attack from other magical items, feats, and class or racial features. However, this spell cannot reproduce any spells or other limited-use magical effects that you used to enhance that particular attack. This includes such effects as the true strike spell, as well as any area spell you might have placed on the arrow by means of the arcane archer's imbue arrow class feature.
Aspect of the Bear.MOD	DESC:You take on an aspect of a bear. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to natural armor and a +2 enhancement bonus on CMB rolls. You can also perform bull rush, grapple, and overrun combat maneuvers without provoking attacks of opportunity.
Aspect of the Falcon.MOD	DESC:You take on an aspect of a falcon. Your eyes become wide and raptor-like, and you grow feathers on the sides of your head. You gain a +3 competence bonus on Perception checks, a +1 competence bonus on ranged attacks, and the critical multiplier for your bows and crossbows becomes 19-20/x3.  This effect does not stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon, such as the Improved Critical feat or a keen weapon.
Aspect of the Stag.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you take on an aspect of a stag, including some of its physical characteristics. Your features become elongated and sinewy, and you grow a set of antlers you can use for defense. You gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity, your base speed increases by 20 ft., you can move through any undergrowth (including magically manipulated undergrowth) at your normal speed, and can even make a 5-foot step within such terrain.  Furthermore, when you are hit with an attack of opportunity, you can make a single attack with your antlers against the opponent that hit you as an immediate action. This attack uses your highest base attack bonus plus your Strength or Dexterity bonus (your choice) and deals 1d8 points of piercing damage (if you are Medium; 1d6 points of damage if Small) plus your Strength modifier on a successful hit. The antlers have a critical multiplier of 19-20/x2.
Aspect of the Wolf.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you take on an aspect of a wolf, including some of its physical characteristics. You become more rugged, your ears become elongated, and you sprout sharp fangs and fur.  You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity, the scent ability, a +2 enhancement bonus on trip attacks, and can make a trip combat maneuver as a swift action. This trip attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Aura of Greater Courage.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell you strengthen your paladin's aura of courage. Until the end of its duration, all allies within that aura are immune to fear (magical or otherwise). If you do not have the aura of courage class feature, aura of greater courage has no effect.

#Block: B
Ball Lightning.MOD	DESC:You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere's course.  If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a -4 penalty on this saving throw.  Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it's a move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or move solid objects. A ball lightning globe winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
Banish Seeming.MOD	DESC:With a melee touch attack you can dispel an illusion or return a creature to its natural form. This functions as dispel magic directed at the effect in question, except you receive a +2 enhancement bonus on your dispel check and you can only dispel illusions or changes in form created by supernatural effects or spells. If multiple effects are changing the creature's appearance, you can dispel one such effect for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest caster level spells and proceeding to spells with lower caster levels.  The caster level for supernatural abilities such as change shape is equal to the target creature's Hit Dice. A creature returned to its natural form by banish seeming is prevented from changing its form again for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.  Banish seeming has no effect on nonmagical means of changing appearance, such as that provided by a disguise or extraordinary ability.
Bard's Escape.MOD	DESC:You whisk yourself and willing allies out of a tight jam, or instantly transfer yourselves to another location to achieve greater strategic positioning. You can move any allies within range to any other space of your choosing within range. Those spaces need not be in line of sight or line of effect from your original position, but must be open locations on surfaces able to support the creatures teleported. Except as noted above, this spell otherwise functions as dimension door.
Beguiling Gift.MOD	DESC:You offer an object to an adjacent creature, and entice it into using or consuming the proffered item. If the target fails its Will save, it immediately takes the offered object, dropping an already held object if necessary. On its next turn, it consumes or dons the object, as appropriate for the item in question. For example, an apple would be eaten, a potion consumed, a ring put on a finger, and a sword wielded in a free hand. If the target is physically unable to accept the object, the spell fails. The subject is under no obligation to continue consuming or using the item once the spell's duration has expired, although it may find a cursed item difficult to be rid of.
Bestow Grace.MOD	DESC:With this spell you can bestow your divine grace on another good creature for a short amount of time, infusing that creature with a portion of your holy virtue. When you touch the subject, you grant that creature a sacred bonus to its saving throws equal to its Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.
Blaze of Glory.MOD	DESC:You fall unconscious but also unleash a spectacular wave of holy energy that heartens and heals your allies while leaving your opponents daunted and damaged. You can cast this spell as either a standard action on your turn, or as an immediate action when brought to below 0 hit points. If cast as a standard action, you are immediately reduced to -1 hit points, but stable, after casting the spell.  When you cast this spell, any good creature within range is healed for 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels. All evil creatures within range take the same amount as damage instead (a successful Will save halves this damage). In addition, all allies and enemies within range are affected as if by the prayer spell for 1 round per caster level.
Blessing of Courage and Life.MOD	DESC:With this prayer you provide long-lasting succor to a wounded creature. For as long as the effect lasts, the target receives a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and death effects.  At any time while the spell is in effect, the target can choose to end the spell as a swift action for a burst of healing energy. The target loses the saving throw bonus, but is healed of 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).
Blessing of Fervor.MOD	DESC:With this blessing, you call your allies to move forth and empower them to conquer and become victorious. Each round for the duration of this spell, each of your allies can choose one of the following bonuses for that round at the beginning of its turn (their choice): Increase its speed by 30 feet, Stand up as a swift action without provoking an attack of opportunity, Make one extra attack as part of a full attack action, using its highest base attack bonus, Gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves, Cast a single spell of 2nd level or lower as if it were an enlarged, extended, silent, or still spell.  These effects are not cumulative with similar effects, such as those provided by haste or a speed weapon, nor do they actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round. Blessing of fervor does not stack with haste. Blessing of the Salamander.MOD	DESC:When you cast this on a creature, its skin turns slick and clammy and it is able to regenerate damage each round. While under the effects of the spell, the creature gains fast healing 5, fire resistance 20 and a +2 competence bonus to its Combat Maneuver Defense.
Blood Biography.MOD	DESC:You learn the answers to a specific set of questions about a creature so long as you have access to at least one drop of its blood. You can cast this spell on the blood of the living or the dead, but living or undead creatures are entitled to a saving throw to resist the spell. You can cast the spell on dried or fresh blood. Once you cast the spell the answers to the following four questions appear on any flat surface you designate (a wall, a piece of paper, and so on): Who are you? (The name by which the creature is most commonly known), What are you? (Gender, race, profession/role), How was your blood shed? (Brief outline of the events that caused its wound, to the best of the victim's knowledge), When was your blood shed?  These answers always appear in a language you can read even if the creature cannot speak that or any language.
Bloodhound.MOD	DESC:You gain the scent special quality, including the ability to track by scent. You receive a +8 competence bonus on Perception checks involving smell and a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks to track using scent. You take a -4 penalty on saving throws against odor-related effects such as the stench ability and stinking cloud. A creature under the effects of bloodhound can detect poison by scent with a DC 20 Perception check.
Bloody Claws.MOD	DESC:You give a creature the ability to deal bleed damage when making natural attacks so long as the attack deals slashing or piercing damage. This bleed damage for each attack is equal to one-half your caster level (limited to the creature's maximum damage with that attack), though bleed damage does not stack. When two or more attacks deal bleed damage, take the worse effect.
Bomber's Eye.MOD	DESC:This extract allows you to throw weapons farther and more accurately. While this extract is in effect, increase the range of any thrown weapon by 10 feet. In addition, you receive a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls made with thrown weapons.
Borrow Fortune.MOD	DESC:When you make a d20 roll, you may choose to immediately cast this spell to reroll that die before success or failure is known, keeping the more favorable result. For the next two rounds following your casting of the spell, you must roll two dice each time a d20 roll is called for, keeping the less favorable result.
Borrow Skill.MOD	DESC:You borrow one of the target's known skills. After touching the subject, you can make a single check with the chosen skill using the subject's skill ranks, but modified by your own key ability.  If you take longer than the spell's duration to make the check or the check requires more time, then it fails and you must use your own skill ranks (if any). If the borrowed skill is a class skill for you, you gain the +3 bonus on checks using that skill.
Bow Spirit.MOD	DESC:A bow spirit is a shapeless force that hovers about you, taking ammunition from your quiver and firing it. For as long as the bow spirit lasts, you can spend a swift action to direct the bow spirit to fire an arrow or a bolt at a target of your choice, as if the bow spirit were firing the necessary ranged weapon. The bow spirit uses your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier, as well as any bonuses and effects from feats you have that affect ranged attacks, or bonuses from the ammunition it uses.  A bow spirit's attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.  There must be ammunition available for the bow spirit to use, and it expends ammunition as if used by you.  A bow spirit occupies your space, and moves with you.  It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A bow spirit's AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
Brand.MOD	DESC:Brand etches an indelible rune or mark of no more than 6 characters onto a creature, inflicting 1 point of damage. The mark may be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. A brand can be hidden by clothing or removed by scraping it away (causing 1d6 points of damage), though the brand returns if the damage is healed.
Brand (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like brand, except that it inflicts 1d6 points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily. In addition, a greater brand blazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened.  Like the effects of bestow curse, a greater brand cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes a mark of justice.
Break.MOD	DESC:You can attempt to break or at least damage any one Medium or smaller object within range. If the target fails its Fortitude saving throw, it gains the broken condition. If cast on a broken item, that item is destroyed on a failed save.
Brilliant Inspiration.MOD	DESC:You open a link between your mind and the subject's mind, giving advice and encouragement for as long as the spell is in effect. Each time the subject of the spell makes an attack roll, ability check, or skill check, it rolls two d20s and takes the better result. If any roll is a natural 20, the spell's effect ends-your brilliant advice is spent.
Bristle.MOD	DESC:You give a creature the ability to redirect a portion of its innate toughness away from its own defense and toward the amount of damage it deals with natural attacks. Each round, as a swift action at the start of its turn, the creature can choose to reduce some or all of its natural armor bonus to AC and gain an enhancement bonus on all damage rolls for natural attacks equal to that amount. The reduction to natural armor, and thus the enhancement bonus on damage rolls, cannot exceed 1 point per 3 caster levels, to a maximum penalty/bonus of -5/+5 at 15th level. A creature cannot reduce its natural armor bonus to less than 0 with this spell.  All attacks directed against the creature use its adjusted AC until the start of its next turn, at which time it can choose to modify its AC again or keep it at its current level. Creatures make this decision without any need for conscious thought or reflection; even creatures with no Intelligence score can benefit from this spell, although they always opt for the maximum possible reduction and bonus, regardless of any tactical advantage they might lose.
Burning Gaze.MOD	DESC:Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes alight with a glance.  As a standard action as long as this spell's effects persist, you may direct your burning gaze against a single creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire.  Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from burning gaze.  Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack- foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze.
Burst Bonds.MOD	DESC:You blast your restraints with divine wrath, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the target object (maximum 5d6), ignoring hardness of 10 or less. A Fortitude save halves the damage, although only magical restraints receive a saving throw.  You can also target a creature that is grappling or otherwise restraining you (such as by adhesive or the swallow whole ability) with the spell. You don't need to make a touch attack to use burst bonds against a creature, and you can cast this spell without making a concentration check while grappled or pinned. The creature does not take damage as above. If you are grappled and your target fails its save, you may make an immediate attempt to break the grapple (but not reverse it) as a free action, with a +1 luck bonus to your CMB per caster level (maximum +5). If the target creature fails its save and you are restrained by an ability that originally allowed a saving throw, burst bonds allows a new saving throw with a +1 luck bonus per two caster levels (maximum +5).

#Block: C
Cacophonous Call.MOD	DESC:You fill your target's mind with a blaring cacophony of discordant sounds, making it hard for the target to act and concentrate.  The creature gains the nauseated condition for the duration of the spell if it fails its Will save.
Cacophonous Call (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as cacophonous call, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Calcific Touch.MOD	DESC:Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is petrified permanently. Break enchantment, restoration, or stone to flesh can reverse the effects of calcific touch.
Call Animal.MOD	DESC:This spell calls the nearest wild animal of a particular type you designate (provided the animal's CR is equal to or less than your caster level) to seek you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close an animal of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that type capable of reaching you within the spell's duration, you are aware of this fact, but the spell is wasted. Knowledge of the local fauna makes this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a Knowledge (nature) skill check (DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an area.  When the called animal arrives, it approaches to within 5 feet of you and remains nearby for the duration of the spell.  Its starting attitude is indifferent, modified by circumstances and interaction. Other than starting attitude, this spell gives you no special influence or ability to communicate with the called animal, although you may use other spells or abilities to do so.  Once the spell's duration expires, the animal acts in accordance with its attitude. Most animals will likely wander off, but a hostile predatory animal may attack, especially if it is hungry or provoked.  Domesticated animals or animals trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars or animal companions, are unaffected by call animals.
Campfire Wall.MOD	DESC:You can create a barrier around a fire of at least campfire size that shelters everyone inside so long as the fire continues to burn. The barrier appears as a crackling sphere of light and fire that is clearly visible, providing as much illumination as a torch.  The barrier bocks line of sight, granting creatures on either side of the barrier total concealment from creatures on the other side. Any object or creature passing through the barrier from outside takes 1d6 points of fire damage and is also outlined with light equivalent to that of a torch, for 1d6 minutes. Creatures outlined in this way are plainly visible regardless of the light conditions and do not benefit from any sort of concealment, magical or otherwise. The light is not bright enough to have any special effect on undead or creatures vulnerable to light.  Creatures inside the barrier can leave without penalty, but if they try to return they suffer the same consequences as anyone else. If the fire source at the barrier's center is extinguished or moved, the spell ends.
Cast Out.MOD	DESC:With a melee touch attack you blast a single creature and disrupt any magic controlling it. The target takes 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, you make a dispel check against any magic jar effect (including a ghost's malevolence ability) or enchantment (compulsion) spells on the target creature, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a targeted dispel magic spell, except cast out can dispel one such spell for every four caster levels you possess. A successful Will save halves the damage and limits the dispelling to a single spell or effect.
Castigate.MOD	DESC:You compel the target to beg for forgiveness. On a failed save, the target cowers with fear. On a successful save, it is shaken for 1 round. Each round on its turn, a cowering subject may attempt a new save to end the effect. A creature who worships the same god as you takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw.
Castigate (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as castigate, except it affects many creatures.
Challenge Evil.MOD	DESC:You challenge an evil creature to bring the fight to you, or suffer the consequences. You gain a +2 sacred bonus on all melee attacks against the subject of the spell. At the end of its turn, if the target has not made at least one attack on you, it becomes sickened. If you move away from the target, the spell ends.
Chameleon Stride.MOD	DESC:You fade into the background, and while you are not truly invisible, you are hard to pinpoint due to your translucent state.  While under the effects of this spell, you gain a +4 bonus on Stealth checks and have concealment from creatures more than 5 feet away (attacks have a 20%% miss chance).
Clashing Rocks.MOD	DESC:You create two Colossal-sized masses of rock, dirt, and stone and slam them together against a single creature between them. The clashing rocks appear up to 30 feet away from the target on opposite sides and rush toward it with a mighty grinding crash. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target with the rocks. The clashing rocks ignore concealment and cover, and if there is a solid barrier between the target and either of the clashing rocks, the spell has a +28 bonus on the Strength check to burst through the barrier and continue unimpeded to the target. A creature struck by the clashing rocks takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the target fails a Reflex saving throw, it is also buried under the resulting rubble as if by a cave-in (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 415).  If the clashing rocks miss the target, the target still takes 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage from falling rocks and is knocked prone. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage to half and the target remains standing. Creatures other than the target that occupy the spaces where the clashing rocks appear or within their path (30 feet wide, 30 feet high, and up to 60 feet long) must also make Reflex saves or take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (save for half and remain standing). A creature can only take damage once from the clashing rocks, no matter how many times the clashing rocks pass over a target creature.
Cleanse.MOD	DESC:Positive energy infuses and cleanses your body. This spell cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) and ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting you: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, and sickened. In addition, cleanse functions as break enchantment upon a single additional effect of your choice that is affecting you and that can be legally affected by this effect.  If used by undead or other creatures healed by negative energy, the spell cleanses with negative energy rather than positive.
Cloak of Dreams.MOD	DESC:You are surrounded by a soporific aroma that causes living creatures that begin their turn or end their movement within 5 feet of you to fall asleep for 1 minute. Creatures must save each time they begin their turn or end their movement within the cloak of dreams, even if they have previously saved against the effect. Sleeping creatures are helpless but can be awakened with a standard action or after being wounded.  Creatures with the scent special quality have a -4 penalty on their saves.
Cloak of Shade.MOD	DESC:This spell provides the subject with some degree of protection from the harmful effects of the sun. The cloaked subject treats environmental heat due to sun exposure as one level less: severe heat is considered very hot conditions, while very hot is considered average temperature (see page 444 of the Core Rulebook for heat dangers). The cloak of shade also reduces any penalties from sunlight by 1. The spell does not, however, eliminate the effects of direct sunlight on creatures vulnerable to sunlight. Cloak of shade has no effect on environmental heat from sources other than the sun.
Cloak of Winds.MOD	DESC:You shroud a creature in a whirling screen of strong, howling wind. The subject is never checked or blown away by strong winds of windstorm or lesser strength (whether natural or magically created), and ranged attack rolls against the subject take a -4 penalty. Tiny or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save to successfully touch or attack the subject in melee. Failure knocks the attacker prone and pushes it 5 feet away from the subject per level of the caster. This movement can pass through the squares of other creatures without affecting them and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but the creature takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage, plus 1d6 if the creature strikes a solid object that blocks its movement.
Confess.MOD	DESC:You ask the target creature a single question. On the subject's next action, it must answer truthfully in the same language as the question or take 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) and be sickened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Will save negates the sickening effect and halves the damage. A creature that is unable to answer still takes damage.
Contagious Flame.MOD	DESC:You blast several enemies with beams of fire. You may fire three rays, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of five rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.  The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.  Every round on your turn, a new ray of fire launches from each creature who took damage from the spell in the previous round-these new rays attack as if you fired them, but their point of origin is the previous creature damaged. You can choose the new targets as a free action, all of whom must be within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of their new starting point. This contagion of flame continues for a total of three rounds-a creature can be struck more than once by this spell over the course of these three rounds, although never by a ray of fire that launches from itself.
Coordinated Effort.MOD	DESC:Choose a single teamwork feat that you possess. You forge a link with your allies, allowing them to gain the benefits of the chosen feat even if they do not have it themselves. You must be a part of the group qualifying for a given bonus for your allies to gain the benefits. For example, two of your allies flanking an orc would gain no benefit from your Outflank feat, but an ally flanking the orc with you would. Your allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for either of you to receive the listed bonus.
Corruption Resistance.MOD	DESC:You grant the touched creature limited protection from magical effects that inflict damage based on the target creature's alignment, such as holy smite, order's wrath, a paladin's smite evil attack, or an unholy weapon. Choose one alignment type: chaos, evil, good, or law. The subject takes 5 less points of damage from effects that specifically harm creatures of that alignment. The value of the protection increases to 10 points at 7th level and 15 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.  Corruption resistance protects against spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities, not physical attacks. Corruption resistance only protects against damage. The subject can still suffer side effects from such attacks. When you use this spell to protect an alignment, it gains the descriptor of that alignment.
Coward's Lament.MOD	DESC:You compel an opponent to face you in combat, or suffer for its cowardice. Each round that the target fails to attack you in melee, it receives a cumulative -1 penalty to its Armor Class, attack rolls, and saving throws (maximum penalty -5). Each round at the end of its turn, the target may attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the penalties from increasing for that round. All penalties reset to zero when the target attacks you in melee, but increase again if it stops attacking. If the target is prevented from attacking you by physical restraint, magic, or impassable terrain, the penalties do not increase. If you move away from the target, the spell ends.
Crafter's Curse.MOD	DESC:The target of crafter's curse takes a -5 penalty on all Craft skill checks while the spell lasts.
Crafter's Fortune.MOD	DESC:The target is struck by inspiration and gains a +5 luck bonus on its next Craft skill check.
Create Pit.MOD	DESC:You create a 10-foot-by-10-foot extradimensional hole with a depth of 10 feet per two caster levels (maximum 30 feet).  You must create the pit on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension, the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to jump to safety in the nearest open space. In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect.  Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal.  The pit's coarse stone walls have a Climb DC of 25. When the duration of the spell ends, creatures within the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on the surface over the course of a single round.
Create Treasure Map.MOD	DESC:You can take a piece from a dead creature's body and use it to create a map that reveals the locations of any valuables that creature knew about while still alive. You must cut this piece off yourself and the creature cannot have died more than 24 hours prior to the casting of this spell. You cannot cast this spell on a creature without a physical body, and the portion you remove must have a fairly level surface such as a piece of hide, carapace, or skin. The map you create is accurate to the best knowledge the creature had at the time of its death. It reveals the location of one source of treasure for every three caster levels you possess.  Any inaccuracies or faulty information held by the creature are represented on the map as well. Similarly, the map cannot account for any changes that occur after the creature's death.  You must choose the scale of the map when creating it, opting between nearby (e.g., one or two dungeon levels), local (e.g., a valley or community), or broad (e.g., a country or larger). The map reveals the locations of what the creature deemed most valuable within its area. Depending on the creature, the map might reveal a source of tasty food, suitable mates, or even your own treasure vault.
Cup of Dust.MOD	DESC:You curse the target with a thirst no drink can quench. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to dehydrate (see page 444 of the Core Rulebook for starvation and thirst). The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of drinking can counter this effect, although the target still experiences the other normal effects of any liquid imbibed (such as poisons or potions). Cup of dust can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell, but effects suffered as a result of dehydration must be healed by normal means.

#Block: D, E
Dancing Lantern.MOD	DESC:You can animate a lantern and order it to follow you. The lantern floats at shoulder height and remains within 5 feet of you, no matter how fast you move. The lantern cannot support any additional weight. The lantern illuminates its normal area, even if it does not have any oil in it. For the purposes of spells or effects targeting it the lantern always acts as if in your possession even when not directly on your person. A dancing lantern can be made permanent with a permanency spell (CL 9th, 2,500 gp).
Deadly Finale.MOD	DESC:You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell.  With a flourish, you immediately end your performance, dealing 2d8 points of sonic damage to each target. In addition, each target takes 3d6 points of bleed damage for 1d6 rounds. A save negates the bleed damage but not the sonic damage.
Deafening Song Bolt.MOD	DESC:Three notes you sing or perform become tangible bolts of arcane energy that shriek across the battlefield. Each bolt requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 3d10 points of sonic damage, deafening the target for 1d6 rounds. The bolts may be fired at the same or different targets, but all must be fired simultaneously.
Defile Armor.MOD	DESC:As sanctify armor, except you gain DR 5/good when using your judgment or smite ability.
Deflection.MOD	DESC:You surround yourself in a whirling barrier of force that sends any attack that misses you hurling back toward its source.  This applies to any melee or ranged attack directed against you so long as it uses an attack roll to determine whether or not it strikes you. If an attack misses you, the attacker must make a second attack roll against its own Armor Class, using all of the applicable modifiers of the original attack and if it hits, the attacker takes the attack's damage and suffers all the other consequences of getting struck with that attack. You cannot deflect attacks that miss you for any reason besides a failed attack roll (such as concealment). Similarly, you cannot deflect attacks that actually do strike you but simply fail to do any harm.
Delayed Consumption.MOD	DESC:When you consume this extract, you quickly consume another extract of your choice-this second extract's effects do not come into effect until a later point. You must consume this second, companion extract on the round following delayed consumption or waste the extract. The companion extract can be no higher than 4th level, and you must pay any costs associated with the companion extract when you consume it. At any point during the duration of this extract, you can cause the companion extract to take effect as an immediate action. You can only have one delayed consumption in effect at one time. If a second is consumed, the first is dispelled without any effect.
Denounce.MOD	DESC:You speak out against a single creature within line of sight and turn possible allies against it by drawing upon the power of your voice and conviction. Creatures in the area who can see the denounced creature must make a Will saving throw or have their starting attitude toward the denounced creature worsened by two levels (see page 94 of the Core Rulebook). For example, creatures previously indifferent to the subject turn unfriendly.  Diplomacy checks made to reverse the effects of denounce are made at a -10 penalty.
Detect Aberration.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like detect animals or plants, except it detects creatures of the aberration type.
Detonate.MOD	DESC:You flood yourself with a potent surge of elemental energy.  One round after completing the casting of the spell, the energy explodes from your body.  When this spell creates the explosion of energy, choose one of the following four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The explosion inflicts 1d8 points of damage of that energy type per caster level (maximum 10d8) to all creatures and unattended objects within 15 feet, and half that amount to targets past 15 feet but within 30 feet. You automatically take half damage from the explosion, without a saving throw, but any other energy resistance or energy immunity effects you may have in place can prevent or lessen this overflow damage caused by the explosion.
Devolution.MOD	DESC:This spell causes an eidolon to lose one evolution plus one additional evolution for every five caster levels. Evolutions with the highest total cost are lost first. If there is a tie, randomly determine which is lost. If this spell causes an eidolon to fail to meet the prerequisites for other evolutions or abilities, those evolutions or abilities are lost as long as this spell persists.
Discordant Blast.MOD	DESC:You create a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-footradius burst centered on you or in 30-foot cone-shaped burst.  Creatures in the area take 3d6 points of sonic damage and are pushed away as if bull rushed. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature in the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Charisma modifier. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A discordant blast cannot penetrate a silence spell (or any similar magical silence effect).
Divine Transfer.MOD	DESC:With a single touch, you transfer some of your life essence to the subject, transferring your hit points and your resolve. When you touch the subject you can transfer up to a number of hit points equal to your Constitution score to the target. These hit points heal the subject, but cannot raise the subject's hit points higher than its normal hit point total. In addition, the subject gains DR/evil equal to your Charisma bonus (if any) for the duration of the spell.
Divine Vessel.MOD	DESC:You accept otherworldly energies into your body and transform.  Your size increases by one category, your height doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. Your features shift into those of a cold and alien being of logic, a creature of primal chaos, an angelic presence, or a fiendish monster, as chosen by you. You gain a +6 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +3 natural armor bonus, darkvision 60 ft., and SR of 12 + your caster level. These modifiers replace the normal modifiers for increasing your size. The size modifier for AC, attacks, CMB, and CMD changes as appropriate for your new size category.  This spell doesn't change your base speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate for your new size.  If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process (see page 175 of the Core Rulebook for rules on breaking objects). If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you-the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.  All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by this spell. Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage.  Magical effects that increase size do not stack.  You gain additional abilities as noted below.  Anarchic aspect: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Constitution, DR 10/lawful, resist acid 10, electricity 10, and sonic 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, blindsense 30 feet, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain a bite attack dealing 2d6 points of damage. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.  Axiomatic aspect: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Strength, DR 10/chaotic, resist cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, low-light vision, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 slam attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.  Celestial aspect: You gain the following abilities: a +2 bonus to Dexterity, DR 10/evil, resist acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, low-light vision, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You gain 2 slam attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered goodaligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.  Fiendish aspect: You gain the following abilities: an additional +2 bonus to Strength, DR 10/good, resist acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, a +4 bonus on saves against poison, see in darkness, and a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).  You gain 2 claw attacks dealing 1d6 points of damage each. Your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are considered evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance.  When used to assume an anarchic, axiomatic, celestial, or fiendish aspect, this spell is a chaotic, lawful, good, or evil spell respectively.
Draconic Reservoir.MOD	DESC:Draconic reservoir functions as protection from energy, absorbing 6 points of one type of energy damage per caster level (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, maximum 60 points). Each round, as a swift action, the subject can release 1d6 points of the absorbed energy and apply it to any melee attack, as if using an acidic, flaming, frost, or shock weapon. The first creature the subject strikes with this attack takes the energy damage in addition to any other consequences of the attack.  Releasing energy in this way does not “free up” space to absorb still more energy; the maximum amount of energy the spell can absorb remains fixed. The subject cannot release more energy than he currently has absorbed. Once the subject has absorbed all the energy allowed by the spell, he takes damage as normal from that energy type. Once the energy has been released, the spell is discharged.  Draconic reservoir does not stack with protection from energy.  Draconic reservoir overlaps (and does not stack with) resist energy. If a character is warded by draconic reservoir and resist energy, draconic reservoir absorbs damage until it reaches its maximum limit.
Dragon's Breath.MOD	DESC:You breathe out a blast of energy. Creatures in the affected area take 1d6 points of energy damage per caster level (maximum of 12d6). A successful Reflex save results in half damage. The spell's effect and energy type depend on the type of dragon scale used: Black dragon: 60-foot line of acid.  Blue or bronze dragon: 60-foot line of electricity.  Green dragon: 30-foot cone of acid.  Gold or red dragon: 30-foot cone of fire.  Silver or white dragon: 30-foot cone of cold.  Brass dragon: 60-foot line of fire.  Copper dragon: 60-foot line of acid.
Dust of Twilight.MOD	DESC:A shower of iridescent black particles clings to and extinguishes torches, lanterns, sunrods, and similar mundane light sources and dispels any spell of 2nd level or lower with the light descriptor (as dispel magic). Creatures in the area must make a Fortitude save or become fatigued.
Eagle Eye.MOD	DESC:Eagle eye creates a magical sensor directly above you. The sensor can appear anywhere above you, to a maximum height equal to the spell's range. You can see from this vantage as if you were actually there, rotating your viewpoint 360 degrees.  You perceive with your normal visual senses. A caster using eagle eye can easily see for a considerable distance. The spell does not penetrate any solid surface, although it is unaffected by foliage and the like.
Elemental Aura.MOD	DESC:This spell forms an aura of energy around you, damaging all those that come near you. Choose an energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Creatures adjacent to you when this spell is cast and at the start of your turn take 2d6 points of energy damage of the selected type. This aura has an additional effect, depending upon the type of energy chosen.  Acid: Creatures affected by your aura take 1 point of ongoing acid damage per round for 1 round per three caster levels, and are sickened for the duration of the ongoing acid damage.  Cold: Creatures affected by your aura are fatigued. A creature that is already fatigued suffers no additional effect.  Electricity: Creatures affected by your aura are staggered for 1 round.  Fire: Creatures affected by your aura catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444).  Creatures adjacent to you are allowed a Reflex save to halve the damage and negate the additional effect. The aura's additional effects do not stack if a creature takes damage from your aura multiple times. You may only have one elemental aura in effect at one time. When you cast this spell to deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, it is a spell of that type.
Elemental Speech.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you to converse with creatures associated with a chosen element, including but not limited to true elemental creatures. This spell gains the elemental subtype based on the version of the spell you cast. Elemental speech does not guarantee a friendly reaction; it merely enables communication. You may converse with all creatures of the selected type with an Intelligence score of 1 or greater, even if they do not understand one another.  When cast as an air spell, you can converse in Auran and with any creature that has the air subtype or a fly speed.  When cast as an earth spell, you can converse in Terran and with any creature that has the earth subtype or a burrow speed.  When cast as a fire spell, you can converse in Ignan and with any creature that has the fire subtype.  When cast as a water spell, you can converse in Aquan and with any creature that has the water subtype or a swim speed.
Elemental Touch.MOD	DESC:Upon completing the casting of this spell, elemental energy infuses your hands. Choose an energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You gain a melee touch attack causing 1d6 points of damage of that energy type, along with a special effect described below. You also deal energy damage and the related special effect when you attack with your hands using an unarmed strike, a single claw, or a single slam attack. This bonus damage can never apply to multiple weapons.  Acid: Your touch attack causes 1 point of ongoing acid damage per round for 1 round per three caster levels. The target must make a Fortitude save or be sickened for the duration of the ongoing acid damage.  Cold: The target must make a Fortitude save or be fatigued.  A creature that is already fatigued suffers no additional effect.  Electricity: The target must make a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round.  Fire: Your hands ignite and shed light as a torch. Your touch may cause targets to catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444).  Subsequent attacks inflict the normal damage, but the additional effects do not stack. This spell grants no special protection to anything held in or worn on your hands. When you cast this spell to deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, it is a spell of that type.
Elude Time.MOD	DESC:You place yourself in a state of suspended animation, similar to temporal stasis. At the time of casting, you choose when the stasis will expire, up to the maximum duration of the spell.  Until the duration ends, time ceases to flow for you, and all bodily functions cease. No force or effect can harm you until the spell expires or is removed, such as by a successful dispel magic spell.
Enemy Hammer.MOD	DESC:You grab a creature with telekinesis and use it to batter nearby opponents or objects. You must target a specific creature when casting this spell and once you select that creature you cannot switch to another. Each round, as a standard action, you can attempt to hurl the target at any creature or object within 30 feet of it. You must make an attack roll whenever you use the target as a weapon. The attack bonus for this attack is equal to your caster level plus either your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). If you successfully hit the new target with the creature both it and the creature take damage based on the creature's size: Fine 1d4, Diminutive 1d6, Tiny 1d8, Small 1d10, Medium 2d6, Large 2d8, Huge 2d10, Gargantuan 3d6, Colossal 3d8.  The target creature can make a Fortitude saving throw each time you attempt to use it as a weapon. If it makes its saving throw it can act normally, but if it fails its save it loses all actions for the round and ends its turn prone in a square adjacent to the target of your attack. However, if the creature chooses to resist your efforts to move it, taking no other actions for the round, it gets a +4 circumstance bonus on its saving throw. The spell ends immediately if the target creature dies or is destroyed.
Enter Image.MOD	DESC:You gain a dim impression of the activities around any object bearing your face or form and can also project your consciousness into one such object at a time, allowing you to observe or even interact with nearby creatures. This spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously monitor the immediate area around any depiction of your image whether one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a Perception check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 Perception check to notice it.  You may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range with your consciousness. While inside an image you lose the ability to monitor any other images within range but remain fully aware of your own body's surroundings. Your body is defenseless and helpless (always failing any saving throw) while your consciousness is filling an image, but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action.  When you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave their square without assistance.  Portraits or similar two-dimensional representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image.  You may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it. If someone destroys or damages the image you return to your body unharmed. The spell lasts until you cease concentrating, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as a dispel magic cast upon either the image or your body, or if your body is killed.
Euphoric Tranquility.MOD	DESC:A creature under the effect of this enchantment enters a state of euphoria. The target treats all creatures as dear friends and abhors violence, but may rise up to protect itself if violence is perpetrated against it. Until the end of the spell's duration, the creature's speed is halved, and it cannot make attacks or cast spells. If the creature is attacked, it gets a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature can make act normally for 1 round. If the saving throw fails, the creature moves half its speed away from the attacker as its next action.  Furthermore, if the creature is interacted with, or questioned while under the effects of this spell, it is considered to have an attitude of Helpful (see the Diplomacy skill, Core Rulebook 94), though any advice or answers it gives may be disjointed or stream of consciousness due to its euphoric state.
Evolution Surge.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as lesser evolution surge, except that you can grant any evolution whose total cost does not exceed 4 evolution points.
Evolution Surge (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as lesser evolution surge, except that you can grant any two evolutions whose total cost does not exceed 6 evolution points.
Evolution Surge (Lesser).MOD	DESC:This spell causes your eidolon to take on new characteristics.  You can grant the eidolon any evolution whose total cost does not exceed 2 evolution points. You may only grant one evolution with this spell, even if that evolution can be taken multiple times.  You can grant an evolution that allows you to spend additional evolution points to upgrade that evolution. This spell cannot be used to grant an upgrade to an evolution that the eidolon already possesses. The eidolon must meet any prerequisites of the selected evolution. This spell does not allow an eidolon to exceed its maximum number of natural attacks.
Expeditious Excavation.MOD	DESC:You can excavate and move earth, dust, and sand up to the size of a 5-foot cube. If you are buried, you may open a 5-foot cube around yourself, but the spell cannot be used for tunneling.  Besides its mundane applications, you can open a 5-foot-deep pit at a creature's feet. A Medium or smaller creature falls prone in the pit unless it succeeds on a Reflex save. With a successful save, it can choose to land harmlessly on its feet in the pit or hop to an adjacent square; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature can escape a 5-foot-deep pit with a DC 5 Climb check. Larger creatures may ignore pits smaller than their size.  The earth excavated by this spell is ordinarily distributed harmlessly across the spell's range, but you may choose to throw up a burst of grit and debris when you dig a pit. This cloud of debris provides concealment to any creatures in the square affected and all adjacent squares for 1 round. Expeditious excavation has no effect on solid rock or earth creatures.
Expend.MOD	DESC:You cause all creatures in the affected area to use up one or more of their limited-use magical abilities without any actual effect. A limited-use magical ability is any supernatural or spelllike ability which a creature can only activate a certain number of times during a set interval (3/day, 1/hour, etc.). The spell does not affect abilities which the creature can use at will or which are constant. It also does not apply to magical items or anything else external to a creature. A creature in the spell's area must make a Will saving throw or expend a single use of one of its abilities. Abilities with the greatest number of uses per day are affected first; if more than one ability has the same number of uses, randomly determine which one is affected first. Creatures must continue making Will saves, expending an additional use of an ability for each failed save, until they succeed, at which point the spell has no further effect.

#Block: F
Feast of Ashes.MOD	DESC:You curse the target with a hunger no food can assuage. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to starve (see page 444 of the Core Rulebook). The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of eating can counter the effect and, further, even attempting to eat causes the target to become nauseated for 1 round unless they make a DC 12 Fortitude save. The target still experiences the other normal effects of anything consumed (such as poisons or potions).  Feast of ashes can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell, but effects suffered as a result of starvation must be healed by normal means.
Feather Step.MOD	DESC:For the duration of this spell, the subject ignores the adverse movement effects of difficult terrain, and can even take 5-foot steps in difficult terrain.
Feather Step (Mass).MOD	DESC:As feather step, except this spell affects multiple creatures. Fester.MOD	DESC:Necrotic energy permeates the target, blocking healing abilities.  The subject gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your caster level against effects that restore hit points or grant temporary hit points. In addition, any healing provided by effects that ignore spell resistance (such as fast healing, regeneration, and some spells) are halved. If the target succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw, fester lasts only a single round.
Fester (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as fester, except that it affects multiple foes. Fiery Body.MOD	DESC:This spell transforms your body into living flame. You and your equipment are immune to fire damage. In fact, every time you would normally take damage from fire, you are instead healed of damage at a rate of 1 point per 3 points of damage the fire attack would have normally inflicted. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells that affect your physiology or respiration. You take only half damage from acid or electricity. You take 150%% as much damage from cold than normal.  You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score and a fly speed of 40 ft. (perfect maneuverability). Your unarmed attack deals an additional 3d6 points of fire damage, and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. Your body burns so brightly that creatures who do not avert their gaze from you are dazzled. Fire spells you cast have their save DCs increased by +1. If you enter water, you are surrounded by a 5-foot radius of steam and bubbles that grant you concealment (50%% miss chance) but you take 2d6 points of damage each round you remain in water.
Fire Breath.MOD	DESC:Up to thrice during this spell's duration, you can belch forth a cone of fire as a standard action. The first cone deals 4d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area. The second cone of flame deals 2d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area. The third cone of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. After the third cone of flame, the spell ends.
Fire of Entanglement.MOD	DESC:The next creature you attack using your smite evil class ability is wreathed in flames that impede its movement.  Until the end of the spell's duration, the target is entangled.  If the target starts its turn in a square adjacent to you, it is considered to be entangled to an immobile object (you) and cannot move. A target that saves against this spell is affected for only 1 round.
Fire of Judgment.MOD	DESC:After casting this spell, the next creature you attack using your smite evil class ability is engulfed in flames of positive energy. At the start of its turn, the target takes 1d6 points of damage, and takes an additional 1d6 points of damage each time it attacks a creature other than you. If the creature is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature this damage increases to 1d10. With a successful saving throw, a creature is affected by this spell for only 1 round. This damage is divine in nature and bypasses any DR the creature possesses.
Fire of Vengeance.MOD	DESC:After casting this spell, the next creature you attack using your smite evil class ability is engulfed in holy flames that flare up when the target attacks someone other than you. If at any time during the duration of your smite evil effect the target makes an attack that does not include you, it takes 3d8 points of fire damage. Once triggered in this manner, or when your smite evil ability expires, the spell ends.
Fire Snake.MOD	DESC:You create a sinuous line of flames that you may shape as desired. The fire snake affects one 5-foot square per caster level, and each square must be adjacent to the previous square, starting with you. The fire snake may not extend beyond its maximum range. Creatures in the path of the fire snake take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).
Firebrand.MOD	DESC:You mark several allies with a flaming rune. This rune does not cause damage, and sheds light as if it were a torch. While the firebrand burns, any creature it marks is immune to damage from any fire spell you cast. All of the target's weapons (both natural and manufactured) inflict +1d6 points of fire damage on a hit (this bonus fire damage stacks with any amount of fire damage a creature's weapons might already inflict). At any point during the spell's duration, a creature bearing a firebrand can launch a beam of fire at any target within 30 feet as a swift action. This ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 6d6 points of fire damage. Once a creature uses its firebrand to fire a ray in this manner, the effects of the spell end for that creature.
Firefall.MOD	DESC:Firefall causes a fire to erupt into a geyser of dazzlingly bright liquid flame. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire larger than a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, but a creature of the fire subtype used as the source takes 1 point of damage per caster level (no saving throw).  The coruscating rain of fire fills a hemispherical burst with a radius of 60 feet. All creatures and objects in the area take 5d6 points of fire damage and catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444).  Creatures who make successful Reflex saves take half damage and don't catch on fire. Creatures within 120 feet of the original fire source are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).
Flames of the Faithful.MOD	DESC:With a touch, you cause a glowing rune to appear on a single weapon, granting that weapon the flaming property (and allowing it to cause an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit). If you are using the judgment class feature, your weapon gains the flaming burst property instead. The spell functions only for weapons that you wield. If the weapon leaves your hand for any reason, the spell effect ends. The effects of this spell do not stack with any existing flaming or flaming burst weapon property that the target weapon may already possess.
Flare Burst.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as flare, except it affects all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst from the target point.
Fluid Form.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, your body takes on a slick, oily appearance. For the duration of this spell, your form can stretch and shift with ease and becomes slightly transparent, as if you were composed of liquid. This transparency is not enough to grant concealment. You gain DR 10/slashing and your reach increases by 10 feet. In addition, you can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with anything you were carrying at the time the spell was cast (except other creatures). Finally, you can move through water with a swim speed of 60 feet and can breathe both water and air for the duration of this effect. You are treated as if you had the water subtype while this spell is in effect.
Fly (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as fly (Core Rulebook 284), save that it can target numerous creatures and lasts longer.
Foe to Friend.MOD	DESC:Cast this spell when an enemy is about to make an attack against an ally. The creature makes the attack against a valid target of your choice instead or the attack is negated.  In addition, the target is considered an ally for determining flanking for 1 round.
Follow Aura.MOD	DESC:Choose one alignment type: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. You gain the ability to follow the trail of a strong or overwhelming aura of that alignment (see detect evil, Core Rulebook 266). This is treated as tracking using the scent special quality, except you are following the traces of their aura upon the ground rather than their scent, and you receive no bonus on Perception checks. At 10th level, you can track the trail of creatures with a moderate alignment aura as well.  When you use this spell to track a given alignment, it gains the descriptor of the opposite alignment. For example, when follow aura is used to track evil, it gains the good descriptor.
Fool's Forbiddance.MOD	DESC:Through your antics and performance, you create an area of warding that adversely affects all enemies that dare enter it. When an enemy creature enters the area it must make an immediate Will saving throw. If it fails, the creature is confused as long as it is in the area and for 1 round after it leaves. If it succeeds on the saving throw, the creature is staggered as long as it is in the area and for 1 round after it leaves.
Forced Repentance.MOD	DESC:You force an evil creature that does not have the evil subtype to momentarily reflect on its past actions and be overcome by grief and conscience. The target immediately drops prone and begins to loudly confess all of its sins and transgressions to the caster for the duration of the spell. The spell immediately ends if you move out of line of sight or if the target is attacked.
Frozen Note.MOD	DESC:You produce and sustain a single perfect musical note that holds nearby creatures, friend as well as foe, utterly spellbound until you stop singing. Affected creatures are both paralyzed and oblivious to their surroundings so long as you maintain the note.  Maintaining this note requires your absolute attention; if you take damage or take any other action, including moving from your current square, the spell instantly ends. Creatures that succeed in their initial saving throw must make a new one for each round they spend within the area of the spell until they fail and become captivated. Creatures with 4 or more Hit Dice greater than your caster level are not affected by this spell. However, those with 4 or more Hit Dice less than your caster level do not receive a saving throw to resist it. The note is so clear and flawless that less than extraordinary attempts to avoid hearing it merely grant targets a bonus on their saving throws. Targets get a +2 circumstance bonus on their saving throw for each barrier between your voice and their ears. This includes such things as a creature stopping up its ears with wax, closing all windows and doors in a nearby building, or even crawling into a barrel and pulling down the top.  If a target that had previously made its saving throw loses the benefit of one or more of its barriers it must immediately make a new saving throw. Similarly, any target that had previously failed its saving throw gets a new save each time it gains the protection of a barrier.

#Block: G, H
Gallant Inspiration.MOD	DESC:This word of arcane-empowered inspiration often ensures success of a crucial endeavor. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll or skill check. The creature gains a +2d4 competence bonus to the attack roll or skill check retroactively.  If the bonus is enough to turn the failure into a success, the roll succeeds.
Getaway.MOD	DESC:Getaway teleports you and allies you designate at the time of casting to a predetermined location. You must initially cast the spell at that location-all creatures affected by the spell must be present at that time and within 30 feet of you. At any time before the spell's duration expires, you may trigger the spell as a swift action. At this time, all affected creatures (or their remains and gear) within 30 feet of you are teleported to the location where you first cast the spell. Creatures more than 30 feet away from you are left behind. Selected creatures within 30 feet of you who do not wish to travel with you at that time can simply choose not to go. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes.
Geyser.MOD	DESC:You cause a column of boiling water to spring forth from any horizontal surface, knocking over creatures directly over it and exposing nearby creatures to searing droplets as its spray falls back to the ground.  Any creature entering the geyser, or occupying the square it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground. If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of fire damage from the boiling water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the geyser (e.g., if the geyser is 50 feet tall, the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the geyser. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it).  This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement.  In addition, the geyser sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the geyser's height (e.g., a 50-foot geyser has a 25-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on them.  You can choose to make a smaller geyser than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that's smaller than what would be created by a full-height geyser spell.
Ghostbane Dirge.MOD	DESC:The target coalesces into a semi-physical form for a short period of time. While subject to the spell, the incorporeal creature takes half damage (50%%) from nonmagical attack forms, and full damage from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects.
Ghostbane Dirge (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as ghostbane dirge, except that it affects multiple targets.
Glide.MOD	DESC:You take no damage from falls (as if from feather fall). In addition, you can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot you fall, at a speed of 60 feet per round. You cannot use this spell to actually gain height, merely coast in other directions as you fall. If subjected to a strong wind or any other effect that causes you to rise you can take advantage of it in order to increase the distance you can glide. The spell ends as soon as your feet touch the ground regardless of its remaining duration. If the spell expires while you are still in the air you fall the remaining distance as normal.
Grace.MOD	DESC:Until the end of your turn, your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Gravity Bow.MOD	DESC:Gravity bow significantly increases the weight and density of arrows or bolts fired from your bow or crossbow the instant before they strike their target and then return them to normal a few moments later. Any arrow fired from a bow or crossbow you are carrying when the spell is cast deals damage as if one size larger than it actually is. For instance, an arrow fired from a Medium longbow normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if fired from a gravity bow (see page 145 of the Core Rulebook for more information). Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses your bow to make an attack the arrows deal damage as normal for their size.
Grove of Respite.MOD	DESC:You conjure a sheltered grove of trees surrounding a shallow spring. The grove appears from nowhere even in the most barren, rocky soil regardless of season, but the spell must be cast outside on open ground.  The area within the grove is temperate and comfortable, like that of a tiny hut, although the grove provides no illumination and provides no protection from the elements. The water in the grove's spring is clean and drinkable. Additionally, the trees provide a variety of ripe fruit, regardless of season, which acts as a goodberry spell for up to eight people. The grove is warded with an alarm spell that alerts you whenever any creature enters the area. Once the spell expires, the grove vanishes, including all fruit, water, and other materials from it, although any nourishment or healing gained from its effects remains.
Guiding Star.MOD	DESC:You form a bond with your surroundings when you cast this spell. For the remaining duration of the spell you can always, as a standard action, determine your approximate distance from that area as well as the direction you must travel in order to reach it. You cannot determine the location of the area if you are on a different plane. The area counts as ”very familiar” for the purposes of teleport or similar spells. You can only attune yourself to one location at a time. If you cast the spell at another spot you lose the ability to locate your original area.
Heroic Finale.MOD	DESC:You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a flourish, you immediately end the performance, and one creature within range affected by your bardic performance can make a move action or a standard action of their choice.
Hero's Defiance.MOD	DESC:The instant before you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, you can expend a use of your lay on hands ability to heal yourself as if you had used lay on hands, plus an additional 1d6 hit points.  If this healing brings your hit point total above 0 hit points, you do not fall, and may continue to act. If you have no more uses of lay on hands this spell has no effect.
Hidden Speech.MOD	DESC:You greatly enhance the ability of the subjects to communicate hidden messages to each other. Each target gains a +10 competence bonus on Bluff checks to send secret message to other recipients. Others using opposed Sense Motive checks to decipher these messages receive a -5 penalty. All subjects affected by the spell must share a language to be able to pass messages.
Hide Campsite.MOD	DESC:You make the area around a campsite appear to be a thicket of untouched and forbidding foliage, or some other unwelcoming feature matching the surrounding terrain. Creatures outside the area cannot sense any activity going on inside the area- they cannot smell campfires or cooking food, they cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast, and they cannot even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area. Those inside the area can see out normally. Once a creature steps into the area of the spell, it can see everything in and around the area normally.
Holy Whisper.MOD	DESC:You whisper a single word in the primordial language of good that is anathema to the minions of evil and strengthens the resolve of good creatures. Evil creatures within the burst must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened for 1 round/ level. Evil outsiders with the evil subtype, evil-aligned dragons, and undead in the burst also take 2d8 points of damage if they fail their saves. Good-aligned creatures in the burst gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 round.
Honeyed Tongue.MOD	DESC:This spell augments your diplomacies. While under the effects of spell, you roll two dice each time you make a Diplomacy check to change a creature's attitude, taking the highest roll.  If this results in a roll low enough to reduce the creature's attitude by a step, that creature gets some clue that you are manipulating it with a spell. Alternatively you can cast this spell before making a Diplomacy check to gather information, gaining a +5 competence bonus on the check.
Hungry Pit.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as create pit, except that the pit has the ability to squeeze and crush any creature trapped within it and has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the hole take falling damage as normal. In addition, anyone within the pit, not just those on the bottom, takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round as the pit contracts and then returns to its normal size (a successful Reflex save halves this damage). The ever-shifting walls of the pit are quite difficult to scale and have a Climb DC of 35.
Hunter's Eye.MOD	DESC:Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against obfuscating effects, hunter's eye greatly enhances your senses against the target creature. You gain the ability to perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the see invisibility spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on Perception checks to locate the target. You ignore concealment provided by fog or mist, blur, displacement, invisibility, and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. This spell provides no benefits to your allies, and no benefits against creatures other than the target.
Hunter's Howl.MOD	DESC:With a single primal howl, you strike fear in your opponents.  Until the end of the spell's duration, you treat those affected by it as if they were your favored enemy, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them, and a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against them. If an affected creature is already one of your favored enemies, it is shaken instead. This is a mindaffecting fear effect.
Hydraulic Push.MOD	DESC:You call forth a quick blast of water that knocks over and soaks one creature or square. You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush against any one creature or object. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Hydraulic push extinguishes any normal fires on a creature, object, or in a single 5-foot square which it is targeted against. Magical fires are unaffected.
Hydraulic Torrent.MOD	DESC:You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all creatures and obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past. Against creatures and moveable objects this stream acts as a bull rush. You can bull rush creatures of any size, not just those one size larger than your own. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  Against immovable objects this stream instead allows you to make a Strength check to destroy the target. When attempting to break an object, the stream has an effective Strength equal to your caster level plus the ability score modifier as above. The Break DC depends on the object you're trying to break-page 175 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook lists several sample Break DCs for various objects.  Hydraulic torrent extinguishes any normal fires it encounters along its path. Magical fires are unaffected.

#Block: I, J, K
Ill Omen.MOD	DESC:You afflict the target with bad luck. On the next d20 roll the target makes, it must roll twice and take the less favorable result. For every five caster levels you have, the target must roll twice on an additional d20 roll (to a maximum of five rolls at 20th level).  A target who can speak and has at least one free hand and who is aware of the spell and its effects (such as from a Spellcraft check to identify the spell as it is cast) can negate one reroll by spending a move action to utter a brief prayer or good luck charm to appease the spirits of ill fortune.
Innocence.MOD	DESC:You surround yourself with an aura of innocence and trustworthiness. You gain a +10 competence bonus on Bluff skill checks to convince others of your innocence. They find it difficult to believe you capable of any wrongdoing. This bonus does not apply to other uses of the Bluff skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating secret messages via innuendo, nor does it apply to any use of the skill to convince anyone of anything other than your complete innocence and blamelessness.
Instant Armor.MOD	DESC:You instantly wrap your body in a suit of armor made from opaque force. At your option, the armor can be decorated with your religion's holy symbol in a prominent place, such as upon the breastplate or helm. While it exists, this armor replaces any garments or other sort of armor worn, magical as well as mundane. You lose access to, and all benefits from, armor replaced by this spell until the spell ends and the instant armor disappears.  Instant armor acts in all ways as armor typical of its type (armor bonus, maximum Dexterity bonus, arcane spell failure chance, and so on). Since instant armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor. The sort of armor you can create with this spell depends on your caster level: 5th or lower chainmail, 6th-8th banded mail, 9th-11th half-plate, 12th or higher full plate.  If you choose to create lesser armor than your level allows you gain a +1 magical enhancement bonus to the armor you do create for every type of armor you pass over. For instance, if you have the capacity to create full plate instant armor you could instead choose to create +1 half-plate, +2 banded mail, or +3 chainmail. You cannot replace these bonuses with armor special properties.
Instant Enemy.MOD	DESC:With this spell you designate the target as your favored enemy for the remainder of its duration. Select one of your favored enemy types. For the duration of the spell, you treat the target as if it were that type of favored enemy for all purposes.
Invigorate.MOD	DESC:This spell banishes feelings of weariness. For the duration, the subject takes no penalties from the fatigued or exhausted conditions. The effect of invigorate is merely an illusion, however, not a substitute for actual rest or respite. When the spell ends, the subject takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, along with the return of the original condition(s). A creature can be under the effects of only one invigorate spell at a time; if it is cast a second time on that creature, the first effect immediately ends.
Invigorate (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell work as invigorate, except it affects multiple creatures.
Jester's Jaunt.MOD	DESC:You teleport the target to a space you can see within 30 feet of the target. The destination must be on solid ground, and the teleportation cannot end in a space that is by nature hazardous to the creature you are teleporting.
Keen Senses.MOD	DESC:The subject gains a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks and gains low-light vision. Subjects that have low-light vision double the distance they can see under the effects of this spell.
King's Castle.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to switch places with an ally. When you cast this spell, choose a single ally within range. You teleport to your ally's space while your ally teleports to your former space.
Knight's Calling.MOD	DESC:You compel an enemy to come and fight you. On its turn, the target moves its speed toward you, avoiding any other dangers along its path (including any movement that would provoke attacks of opportunity). The target may do nothing but move on its turn. If the target ends its move adjacent to you, you can make an attack of opportunity against the target.

#Block: L, M, N, O
Lead Blades.MOD	DESC:Lead blades increases the momentum and density of your melee weapons just as they strike a foe. All melee weapons you are carrying when the spell is cast deal damage as if one size category larger than they actually are. For instance, a Medium longsword normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if benefiting from lead blades (see page 145 of the Core Rulebook for more information). Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses one of your weapons to make an attack it deals damage as normal for its size.
Life Bubble.MOD	DESC:You surround the touched creatures with a constant and moveable 1-inch shell of tolerable living conditions. This shell enables the subjects to breathe freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making them immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases and poisons and spells like cloudkill and stinking cloud. In addition, the shell protects subjects from extremes of temperature (per endure elements) as well as extremes of pressure.  Life bubble does not provide protection from negative or positive energy (such as found on the Negative and Positive Energy planes), the ability to see in conditions of poor visibility (such as in smoke or fog), nor the ability to move or act normally in conditions that impede movement (such as underwater).  When you cast this spell it has a total duration of 2 hours per caster level. You can divide this duration up in any manner you wish, not necessarily equally, between up to 1 creature per caster level.
Light Lance.MOD	DESC:You create a glorious beam of brilliant radiance that acts as a +1 holy lance suitable for your size. You must have a free hand when casting the spell and, once you call the lance into being, you cannot switch it to another hand or put it down without prematurely ending the spell. As a standard action while holding a light lance, you can choose not to make an attack and instead hold the lance aloft as a beacon of light and truth, creating an area of bright light with a radius of 90 feet. If you choose to do this for one or more additional rounds the lance also casts a spear of brilliant light up into the sky that grows progressively more visible as it continues to climb toward the heavens. Under cover of night or other darkness, if nothing obstructs the beam, it becomes visible for an additional 2 miles during each round in which you continue to aim your lance skyward (2 miles in the second round, 4 miles in the third round, and so on).
Lily Pad Stride.MOD	DESC:Your every footstep creates aquatic plants capable of supporting your weight and that of any creature of your size or smaller that is following you. These lily pads only appear when you cross water or other liquids which do not immediately destroy plants. You can walk across these liquid surfaces without any fear of stumbling (though if knocked prone, dragged under, or otherwise pulled off your feet you still sink in the liquid). For the duration of the spell, any creature of your size or smaller can attempt to follow you by making a DC 10 Acrobatics check every round. Each such check allows it to move at half its normal land speed. If the creature takes a -5 penalty on its check it can move at its normal speed.  If a creature fails an Acrobatics check, or if a creature that's larger than you attempts to follow, it falls through, damaging the plants. Each time a creature falls through, all subsequent creatures take a cumulative -5 penalty on their Acrobatics checks when traveling across that particular stretch of plants.  As you move, the lily pads disappear behind you once you pass beyond the spell's range. Otherwise, they remain until the spell's duration expires.
Lockjaw.MOD	DESC:You give a creature the ability to use one of its natural attacks to firmly attach itself to an opponent. Choose one of the creature's natural attacks (usually a claw or bite attack).  The creature gains the grab ability with that natural attack, including the +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to start or maintain a grapple. A creature with multiple natural attacks can strike at its grappled opponent with its other natural attacks, but cannot attack any other creature.
Marks of Forbiddance.MOD	DESC:Marks of Forbiddance magically brand two creatures, preventing them from committing violence against one another. When you cast this spell choose one enemy and one ally within range. Both targets become branded with the sigil of forbiddance. Until the end of the spell's duration, in order for the two targets to attack one another, even with a targeted spell, each attacker must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, that target can attack the other normally.  If the save fails, the target can't follow through with the attack and the action is lost. This spell does not prevent the targets from attacking each other with area of effect spells or abilities.
Mask Dweomer.MOD	DESC:You mask and manipulate a spell's magic aura to make it harder to detect. Select one spell effect on the target creature or object. You must have either cast this spell yourself or have perceived it by means such as detect magic or arcane sight.  Both the desired spell effect and mask dweomer are hidden from detect magic, although more powerful spells (such as arcane sight) pierce the deception if the caster succeeds on a Will save. Analyze dweomer automatically detects both mask dweomer and any masked spell effects.
Memory Lapse.MOD	DESC:You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or opposed skill check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that may be present.
Moonstruck.MOD	DESC:You invoke the mystical power of the moon to drive the target into a mad, bestial frenzy. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round, dropping held items as its nails and teeth elongate and sharpen. The target gains a bite attack and two claw attacks that deal damage appropriate for the creature's size, and for the remainder of the spell's duration the target behaves as if under simultaneous rage and confusion spells, attacking with its natural weapons in preference to other actions. During the final round of the spell's duration, the target is again dazed as it returns to its normal state.
Nap Stack.MOD	DESC:You reduce the amount of uninterrupted sleep or rest creatures within the spell's area need in order to recover from injuries, regain spells, or other special abilities to 2 hours instead of the normal eight. In addition, if creatures continue to sleep or rest beyond the initial 2 hours, every additional 2 hours counts as a day of rest for the purpose of recovering hit points, ability damage, as well as for enduring diseases, poisons, or other afflictions. This means 8 total hours of sleep counts as 4 days for natural healing and for saving throws as diseases or similar afflictions run their course. When suffering from diseases, poison, or other afflictions, sleepers experience vivid dreams that help them track their recovery. If things go poorly they can, at any time, wake themselves up in order to seek a better alternative. If awoken or otherwise disturbed during this 8-hour period, creatures may return to sleep but they no longer enjoy the benefits of the accelerated recovery time. Creatures can only enjoy the benefits of this spell once in any 1-week period.
Natural Rhythm.MOD	DESC:You enhance a creature's ability to harm an opponent based on the number of times it has already injured that opponent with a natural attack. Each time the creature successfully strikes an opponent with a natural attack, the subject gains a cumulative +1 bonus on damage rolls made against that opponent when making natural attacks (maximum +5 bonus). If an attack misses, the bonus to damage for all attacks resets to +0.
Nature's Exile.MOD	DESC:This spell curses the creature touched, making it inimical to the natural world. All animals have an initial attitude of hostile toward the target. Familiars, being magical beasts, are not affected by this spell, but animal companions are. If you have an animal companion, it does not become hostile, but as long as you remain cursed, your animal companion takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. The target also takes a -10 penalty on Survival skill checks as the weather and environment themselves seem to conspire to cause trouble.  Nature's exile can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish.
Negate Aroma.MOD	DESC:With a gesture, this spell allows you to dismiss even the foulest or most distinctive scents. When cast, the targeted creatures or objects lose all natural and unnatural odors. A creature under the effect of negate aroma cannot be tracked, located, or pinpointed by the scent special quality. In addition, this spell prevents the target creature from using the stench special ability and similar odor-based abilities (such as those possessed by troglodytes).  Negate aroma does not prevent the target from acquiring outside smells or odors. Dowsing the creature with a pungent substance effectively negates the benefits of the spell until the substance is neutralized or washed away.
Oath of Peace.MOD	DESC:Entreating your deity for aid, you make a temporary oath of peace, granting you superior defenses but means you can't attack for the duration of the oath. For as long as you are subject to this spell, you gain a +5 sacred bonus to AC and on saving throws, as well as DR 10/evil. If you make a direct or indirect attack or any show any hostility toward any creature, the spell immediately ends.
Oracle's Burden.MOD	DESC:You entreat the forces of fate to bestow your oracle's curse upon another creature. The target creature suffers all the hindrances and none of the benefits of your oracle's curse class feature. You still suffer all effects of your oracle's curse.  If you do not have the oracle's curse class feature, this spell has no effect.

#Block: P, R
Pain Strike.MOD	DESC:Pain strike racks the targeted creature with agony, inflicting 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round for 1 round per level (maximum 10 rounds). Additionally, the affected creature is sickened for the spell's duration, and the caster gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks against the target.
Pain Strike (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell works like pain strike, except as noted above.
Paladin's Sacrifice.MOD	DESC:You open up a brief but powerful divine conduit between you and another creature, taking on the damage and any other effects that creature suffers. When a creature in range is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, you can cast this spell and the wounds and/or effects are magically transmitted to you instead of the target. You are affected as if you were hit by the attack or failed the saving throw, taking all the damage and suffering all of the adverse effects. Any resistances or immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise reduce or negate the damage or effects in any way.  If you use this spell against an effect that also targets you or includes you in its area, you suffer the effects for both yourself and the target you spared, potentially taking damage or suffering other consequences twice.
Perceive Cues.MOD	DESC:Your senses become preternaturally keen, and you gain insight into subtle behavioral cues. For the duration of the spell, you receive a +5 competence bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks.
Phantasmal Revenge.MOD	DESC:When you cast this eerie spell upon a recently slain creature, you cause a ghastly, spectral image of it to rise up from its corpse, shrieking for vengeance before it vanishes in a burst of unnatural light. This phantom then unerringly seeks out the creature that killed it, as long as that creature is on the same plane, and tries to slay its killer in turn.  Only the corpse's killer can see the phantasmal image created by this spell. You and any others who witness the spell's casting or its ultimate effects see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. If that save fails, the target must succeed on Fortitude saving throw or take 10 points of damage per caster level from the phantasmal image. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the target takes 5d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level. You know immediately if the spell succeeded or failed to kill its target but gain no other information, including the identity of the target of the spell.  The creature providing the corpse must have died no more than 1 day per caster level prior to the casting of this spell. If the creature that provided the corpse was not, in fact, killed by another, or if the killer is dead or no longer on the same plane, the spell fails. Phantasmal revenge makes no moral judgments; it targets winners of fair fights just as easily as murderers. Any given body can only be targeted by a phantasmal revenge spell once.
Phantasmal Web.MOD	DESC:You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that they are engulfed in tangled webs teeming with swarms of tiny spiders. Those who fail to disbelieve the phantasmal web are treated as if in a web spell, but must also make a Fortitude save at the beginning of each turn or become nauseated for that round by the phantasmal spiders.  As the phantasmal web exists only in the minds of the targets, it cannot be burned or destroyed, and it provides no cover (though it does provide concealment) against attacks made by the targets. Targets cannot escape the phantasmal web by moving, even by teleportation. Freedom of movement allows unobstructed movement but does not negate the concealment or nausea effects.  Targets of the spell perceive everyone else around them to be engulfed in webs and swarming spiders, but the spell has no visible effect to other creatures (who may assist allies to disbelieve the effect).
Pied Piping.MOD	DESC:You call forth a melody so compelling and attractive that creatures belonging to a group with a specific, identifiable physical trait (such as type, subtype, age, gender, or hair color) find it almost impossible not to approach and follow you. You choose the nature of the creatures you seek to attract when you cast the spell and, once you make this choice, cannot alter it. You can only use physical traits to determine your audience. You can never use social and other more voluntary criteria (such as alignment, religion, nationality, or class) to select targets for this spell.  Eligible creatures must make a saving throw each round spent within the area of the spell and, once they fail, approach you at their normal movement speed and stand as close to you as possible without actually entering an occupied square.  If you move, they do their best to maintain their proximity to you and follow. Affected creatures can take no actions other than listening to your music and following you if you move.  Those entering the area while the spell is in effect must also successfully save or be compelled to come to you.  The attractive power of the spell does not cause affected creatures to put themselves in jeopardy and they have enough presence of mind to avoid or negotiate around obstacles and other perilous hazards. If unable to approach or follow you without endangering themselves, they simply wait, swaying to the music, until you pass out of range, at which point they regain their senses after 1 round/caster level. If circumstances change once you move out of range, making it possible for affected creatures to resume their attempts to get near you they do so, and, if they manage to return to within the area of the spell before it wears off, the spell continues as normal.  If attacked, affected creatures can take defensive measures, even going so far as to avoid existing threats by moving out of the area of the spell, but cannot make attacks themselves or take any other actions until the effects of the spell wear off. The effects of the spell persist for 1 round/caster level even after you stop concentrating. Once the spell ceases, the affected creatures continue to stay near you until the effects of the spell wear off.
Pillar of Life.MOD	DESC:You conjure a pillar of positive energy in a single 5-foot square within range that radiates light as if it were a sunrod. Living creatures adjacent to the pillar can spend a standard action to touch the pillar and heal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Creatures can move into the square containing the pillar, but if an undead creature moves into the pillar it takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Undead creatures vulnerable to bright light take 1d8 points if damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A creature cannot benefit or suffer more than once from a single casting of this spell.
Planar Adaptation.MOD	DESC:Planar adaptation grants you immunity to the harmful environmental effects of a particular plane of existence, including such hazards as toxicity, extreme temperatures, and lack of air. Additionally, you gain energy resistance 20 to a single energy type prevalent on that plane (choose one if more than one type is equally prevalent). Planar adaptation has no effect when cast upon your native plane.
Planar Adaptation (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like planar adaptation, except as noted above.
Pox Pustules.MOD	DESC:You inflict a painful, itching rash on the target creature. The target is sickened and takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity (this penalty cannot lower Dexterity below 0). The target can spend a move action scratching furiously at the rash to remove the sickened condition (but not the Dexterity penalty) until the start of its next turn.
Protective Spirit.MOD	DESC:A protective spirit is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the protective spirit makes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A protective spirit can defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.  A protective spirit occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A protective spirit's AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
Purging Finale.MOD	DESC:You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a flourish, you immediately end your bardic performance, removing one of the following conditions on a creature within range affected by your bardic performance: cowering, dazzled, exhausted, paralyzed, shaken, or stunned.
Purified Calling.MOD	DESC:Your eidolon is restored to full health when you summon it. Upon casting this spell, you must immediately begin the ritual to summon your eidolon. Upon completion of the ritual, your eidolon appears at full hit points and without any damage or penalties to its ability scores, regardless of its previous condition. In addition, any temporary negative conditions affecting your eidolon are immediately removed.  Permanent conditions and ability drain are not affected by this spell.
Putrefy Food and Drink.MOD	DESC:This spell causes otherwise edible food to rot and spoil instantly, and water and other liquids to become brackish and undrinkable. Holy water and similar food and drink of significance are spoiled by putrefy food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type, nor upon unholy water. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.  Although potions and elixirs are unaffected by the normal use of the spell, you can instead choose to target a single such object with this spell, destroying it if it fails a saving throw.
Rally Point.MOD	DESC:You create a spot that has the power to briefly hearten any good creature who comes into contact with it. A good creature who enters this square (even if simply as part of its normal move) gains a +2 morale bonus on attacks, saving throws, and 2 temporary hit points per caster level for 1 round. Nongood creatures gain no benefit from this spell.  A creature cannot benefit more than once from the same casting of this spell.
Rampart.MOD	DESC:You create a massive rampart of hard-packed earth and stone 5 feet thick. The rampart cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as another creature or object. Each 5-foot-wide section of the rampart has hardness 0 and 180 hit points. A section of the rampart whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the rampart with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 60. A creature can climb over the rampart with a DC 20 Climb check.
Rebuke.MOD	DESC:Your wrathful words cause physical harm to your enemies.  Your enemies take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) and are staggered for 1 round. Half of this damage is sonic damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to sonic-based attacks. Rebuke is especially devastating to foes who worship your god, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and stunning them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the staggering or stunning effect.  Enemies do not need to hear a rebuke to be harmed by it, but it is negated by magical silence.
Rejuvenate Eidolon.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as lesser rejuvenate eidolon, except that it cures 3d10 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).
Rejuvenate Eidolon (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as lesser rejuvenate eidolon, except that it cures 5d10 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
Rejuvenate Eidolon (Lesser).MOD	DESC:By laying your hand upon an eidolon, you cause its wounds to close and its form to solidify. This spell cures 1d10 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
Residual Tracking.MOD	DESC:By touching a footprint, you receive a clear mental image of the person or creature that made it. The image has the exact same appearance as the creature that made the footprint at the moment it made the imprint, including any telling features or expressions, any gear or equipment, or anything else the creature was carrying at the time. For example, the footprint of a horse would reveal both the horse and any creature riding it when it made the footprint.
Resounding Blow.MOD	DESC:You must have a melee weapon in hand to cast this spell.  On a successful melee attack, your weapon resounds with a thunderous clash. The target takes 1d6 points of sonic damage. Your weapon is not harmed by this attack.  If you are using your judgment ability or smite ability against the target, it is staggered for 1 round on a successful attack. A successful Fortitude save negates the staggering effect.  On a successful critical hit, the target is stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates the stunning and deafening effects. If you are also using judgment or smite, your foe makes only a single save against all effects.  This spell immediately ends if your weapon leaves your hand.  Resounding blow stacks with the thundering weapon property.
Rest Eternal.MOD	DESC:You place a curse upon a dead creature that bars its spirit from returning. Anyone casting a spell that would communicate with the dead creature, return it to life, or turn it into an undead creature must succeed on a caster level check with a DC of 11 plus your caster level. Rest eternal cannot be dispelled, but it can be negated with remove curse or break enchantment.
Restful Sleep.MOD	DESC:You cast this spell immediately prior to resting. While under the effects of this spell, you and your allies enjoy a restful night's sleep. If a subject completes a full night's rest, it regains hit points as if it had undergone a full day of bed rest (regaining twice its character level in hit points). If a subject completes a full day's rest, it regains three times its character level in hit points. Any significant interruption during the rest (such as being awoken) prevents any healing that night and ends the effect of this spell on the awakened subject. Any healing acquired while under the effects of restful sleep is considered natural healing, and has no affect on effects requiring magical healing to cure.
Resurgent Transformation.MOD	DESC:Resurgent transformation grants you the ability to recover from deadly wounds with restored vitality and a will to fight, but at a price. Once cast, resurgent transformation lies dormant for up to 1 hour per level until you are reduced to one-quarter hit points or less. Once triggered, you immediately gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and Strength, damage reduction 5/-, and the benefits of a haste spell. In addition, you heal 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). Resurgent transformation can even save you from death by healing the damage from an otherwise mortal wound, though it does not prevent death from massive damage or from causes other than hit point loss. Your mental faculties are impaired by this magical transformation, however, causing 1d4 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage.  The advantages from your transformation persist for 1 round per caster level after the spell is triggered. Once the spell ends, it takes a heavy toll, leaving you exhausted and inflicting 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Utilizing more than one resurgent transformation in a day is particularly risky.  The expiration of a second resurgent transformation in a 24- hour period inflicts an additional 1d4 points of Constitution damage and results in death from system shock unless you succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, made after the Constitution damage has been applied.  If the spell expires or is dispelled before the transformation has been triggered, no adverse effects result.
Retribution.MOD	DESC:Retribution blasts those who have the temerity to assault your person. You may target anyone who has just struck you with an attack within the previous round, whether with a melee, ranged, or natural weapon, or a spell that requires an attack roll. The target is wracked with shooting pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skills checks, and ability checks. On a successful Fortitude save, the penalty only lasts for 1 round.  A target who worships the same god as you takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw.
Reviving Finale.MOD	DESC:You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell.  With a flourish, you immediately end your bardic performance, and allies within the area of the spell regain 2d6 hit points. This spell has no effect on undead creatures.
Righteous Vigor.MOD	DESC:Infusing the target with a surge of furious divine energy, you enhance a creature's ability to hit an opponent based on the number of times it has already hit that opponent with a successful attack. Each time the subject successfully strikes an opponent with a successful melee attack, the subject gains a cumulative +1 morale bonus on attack rolls (maximum +4 bonus) and gains 1d8 temporary hit points (to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points). If an attack misses, the attack bonus resets to +0 but any accumulated temporary hit points remain. The temporary hit points disappear at the end of the spell's duration.
River of Wind.MOD	DESC:Summoning up the power of the tempest, you direct a current of forceful winds where you please. This spell creates a 5-foot-diameter line of wind-the direction of the wind is away from your location when you cast the spell, and remains constant in that direction for the spell duration. Creatures caught in a river of wind take 4d6 nonlethal damage and are knocked prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and prevents being knocked prone.  A creature that begins its turn wholly or partially within a river of wind must make a Fortitude save or be pushed 20 feet in the wind's direction of flow, take 2d6 nonlethal damage, and be knocked prone-a successful Fortitude save means the creature merely takes 1d6 nonlethal damage. Creatures under the effect of freedom of movement and creatures with the air subtype are unaffected by a river of wind.

#Block: S
Sacred Bond.MOD	DESC:To use this spell, you first touch the intended recipient, creating a sympathetic field of healing energies between you.  Once the spell has been cast, you and the target may cast conjuration (healing) spells with a range of touch upon each other so long as you are within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). Should either you or the target remove your bracelet, the spell immediately ends.
Sacrificial Oath.MOD	DESC:You create a powerful bond between yourself and a single creature. Until the end of the spell's duration, each time the target is hit with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can take the full damage of that attack and any other effects that creature suffers. If you choose not to take on the damage and effects, you instead take a number of points of damage equal to your Constitution score as backlash. Any resistances or immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise reduce or negate the damage or effects of either the transfer or the backlash. If you or the subject of the spell move out of line of sight, the spell ends.
Saddle Surge.MOD	DESC:You and your mount form a perfect synergy that endows both of you with advantages based upon how far you travel each round. For every 5 feet your mount moves in a given round, you gain a +1 competence bonus on Ride checks and both you and your mount gain a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls made with weapons or natural attacks for 1 round. For instance, if your mount traveled 40 feet in a round, you would gain a +8 bonus on Ride checks and you and your mount would both gain a +8 bonus on damage rolls for 1 round, to a maximum bonus equal to your caster level. You must be mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you dismount, get knocked off, or take any other action that separates you from your mount, the spell immediately ends.
Sanctify Armor.MOD	DESC:You imbue your armor with a righteous aura. It gains a +1 enhancement bonus per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). When using your judgment or smite ability, you gain DR 5/evil.  An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.
Saving Finale.MOD	DESC:You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a flourish, you can immediately end your bardic performance when a creature within range affected by your bardic performance fails a saving throw, allowing the subject to immediately reroll the failed saving throw.
Scent Trail.MOD	DESC:You, or a willing creature you touch, lay down a trail of scents that only the creatures you designate at the time of casting can detect. These creatures find it very easy to follow this trail.  They gain a +20 competence bonus on any Survival checks made for the purpose of tracking the creature laying this trail.  Subject creatures with the scent special ability gain a +10 competence bonus on Wisdom or Survival checks to follow the trail.  In addition, you can leave scent messages along the trail.  Each word or emotion in this message requires spending a move action in the same spot. Subject creatures seeking to understand this message must make another DC 20 Survival check, with a -1 penalty for every word or emotion in the message, in order to understand it. Creatures cannot benefit from this smell if they cannot use, or do not have, a sense of smell. Creatures can use this spell to backtrack through a dungeon, maze, or similar areas even if the creature laying down the trail crossed over the spot multiple times.
Screech.MOD	DESC:You emit a shrill, piercing shriek, startling those around you into dropping their guard. Enemies in the area must make a successful saving throw or immediately provoke attacks of opportunity from foes that threaten them. You and your allies are unaffected by your own screech.
Sculpt Corpse.MOD	DESC:With a clammy caress and a word to the powers lurking beyond death, you can reshape a dead body look like another creature or even a specific person so long as you have firsthand knowledge of how that creature or person actually looks.  You can make the corpse one size larger or smaller and change anything else about it including its apparent type, gender, or age. Creatures with a reason to suspect deception may make a Will saving throw to realize that the corpse was altered. If you chose to make the corpse look like a specific individual anyone who knows that individual can make a Will save to realize that the corpse is not actually that person. However, if a creature fails its Will save by 5 or less they believe the corpse is that of someone who closely resembled the person they knew rather than a deliberate fake. This spell merely changes the appearance of the corpse. Any spell or effect that targets the corpse (such as speak with dead or raise dead) treats it as if it still had its original appearance.
Seamantle.MOD	DESC:You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water up to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the seamantle, but attacks against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have freedom of movement effects. The cover granted by the seamantle does not enable you to make Stealth checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater (such as cloudkill).  The seamantle blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the seamantle; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes effect as a bubble of steam contained within the seamantle rather than its usual effect.  The seamantle allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch.  You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as dispel magic; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as flame blade, flaming sphere, or incendiary cloud). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A flaming or flaming burst weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.
Seek Thoughts.MOD	DESC:Similar to detect thoughts, seek thoughts allows you to sift through the surface thoughts of those around you. You may scan for either the answer to a simple question (such as “Where is the hidden lair of the wererats?”) or for information on a general topic (such as the beliefs of an evil cult). You detect the number of creatures who are thinking about this question or topic within range, as well as their location if they are visible to you. Seek thoughts does not let you read actual surface thoughts, only if a given creature is thinking about the topic you are concentrating on. A successful Will save prevents you from sensing a creature's thoughts for the duration of the spell.  You can maintain concentration on seek thoughts while you engage in normal conversation, allowing you to ask leading questions about topics of interest. A creature conversing with you while you concentrate can notice that you are distracted with a successful DC 25 Sense Motive check.
Shadow Projection.MOD	DESC:With this spell, you infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow, giving it independent life and movement as if it were an undead shadow (see Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 245). Your physical body lies comatose while you are projecting your shadow, and your body has no shadow or reflection while the spell is in effect.  While projecting your shadow, you gain a shadow's darkvision, defensive abilities, fly speed, racial stealth modifier, and strength damage attack. You do not gain the creature's create spawn ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit Dice.  Your shadow has Hit Dice and hit points equal to your own.  Your shadow projection has the undead type and may be turned or affected as undead.  If your shadow projection is slain, you return to your physical body and are immediately reduced to -1 hit points.  Your condition becomes dying, and you must begin making Constitution checks to stabilize.
Share Language.MOD	DESC:You can share your facility for one particular language with another creature. For 24 hours the target can read, understand, and communicate to the best of its ability in any one language which you already know. For every 5 levels you possess, you can grant the use of another language you know, to a maximum of 5 languages at 20th level. The target must have the physical capacity to articulate sounds, make gestures, or engage in whatever other method speakers of the language use to communicate with each other in order to actually converse. If the target lacks the mental capacity to grasp an actual language it still gains enough knowledge to respond to and carry out even extremely complex commands or suggestions coached in the language (whether written or spoken). However, since this spell does not endow the target with greater reasoning capacity, merely a temporarily enhanced vocabulary, the person offering up instructions to non-sentient creatures must take care to remove any ambiguity or guesswork.  Similarly, this spell does not affect the basic nature of the target, or its disposition toward you or anyone else, so convincing it to actually carry out these instructions could require negotiation, threats, or outright bribery.
Share Senses.MOD	DESC:Spending a moment in meditation and conjuring an image of the creature to mind, you reshape your link with your familiar, causing it to functions like a scrying sensor. Upon casting this spell you can hear, see, or smell (any one, your choice) what your familiar is experiencing. You gain the benefits of any nonmagical special abilities your familiar has tied to the chosen sense (such as low-light vision or scent), but use your own Perception skill. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your familiar, but you must have an active empathic link. You may change the sense you are sharing as a standard action. Unlike other scrying spells, share senses does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it, and you are unable to see in magical or natural darkness unless your familiar possesses the ability to see in such conditions.  The sensory link with your familiar can be detected as though it were a scrying sensor.
Shared Wrath.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as wrath, except that you grant multiple creatures the bonuses against your designated foe. All subjects of shared wrath receive their bonuses against the same creature.
Shifting Sand.MOD	DESC:You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the area. The shifting sand obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the shifting sand must make a Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their saving throws.  As a move action, you may move the area of shifting sand up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures that are entangled or prone in the spell's area are carried along with the shifting sand in the same direction if possible. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Medium or smaller objects may also be carried along or shallowly buried by the shifting sand.
Sift.MOD	DESC:You examine an area at range as if you were searching for fine details with the Perception skill. Make a Perception check with a -5 penalty, modified as normal for conditions. No penalty is applied for distance. Apply the result against the DC for any hidden features, such as secret doors, traps, or hidden treasure. You must be able to see the area you are attempting to search, and you only find details that can be perceived with sight or touch. Sift detects only objects and features, not actual creatures.
Sirocco.MOD	DESC:A blast of furnace-hot wind blasts downward, inflicting 4d6 fire damage +1 point per caster level to all creatures in the area and knocking them prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the fire damage and negates being knocked prone.  Flying creatures forced into the ground by the powerful downdraft take damage as if they fell unless they make a DC 15 Fly check, in which case they remain at their original altitude.  Any creature that takes damage from a sirocco becomes fatigued (or exhausted, if already fatigued, such as from a previous round of exposure to a sirocco spell). Creatures with the water subtype take a -4 penalty on all saving throws against this spell and take double normal damage.
Sleepwalk.MOD	DESC:You compel an unconscious or sleeping creature to rise and move in a half-awake state. The target creature staggers about if led or guided, but remains helpless for all other purposes.  The subject moves at half speed and is limited to a single move action each round. It is not capable of moving at a higher rate of speed or taking actions other than movement except by magical assistance, and automatically fails any Dexterity- or Strength-based skill checks. If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking it must make a new saving throw or the spell ends and the creature awakes (if it has more than 0 hit points). When the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and must be awoken normally. While sleepwalk allows an unconscious creature to move, it does not awaken the creature, nor does it stabilize or otherwise heal them. A disabled creature that moves about while under the effects of this spell does not start dying again as a result of this movement.
Slipstream.MOD	DESC:You create a low-cresting wave of water that carries the target along the surface of water or the ground. When moving across level ground, the target's speed increases by 10 feet.  If going downhill, speed increases by 20 feet instead, but slipstream provides no movement bonus when going uphill.  While swimming, the slipstream increases the target's swim speed by 20 feet-if the target does not have a swim speed, this spell grants a swim speed of 20 ft.
Snake Staff.MOD	DESC:With a long hissing whisper, you transform ordinary pieces of wood into various sorts of snakes that immediately attack your foes.  As long as the snakes remain within sight, you can direct their actions telepathically as a free action. You can only apply this spell to wooden objects not in a creature's possession or not part of a larger structure or plant. Each time you cast this spell you can create a number of snakes equal to your caster level. More powerful snakes take up more than one of your available total, as noted below. Snake statistics can be found on page 255 of the Pathfinder Bestiary; details on the advanced and giant simple templates can be found on pages 294-295 of that book.  Venomous Snake: A stick or piece of firewood.  Counts as 1 snake.  Constrictor Snake: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 2 snakes.  Advanced Venomous Snake: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 2 snakes.  Advanced Constrictor Snake: A staff or tree branch.  Counts as 3 snakes.  Advanced Giant Venomous Snake: A log or pile of debris. Counts as 4 snakes.  Advanced Giant Constrictor Snake: A fallen tree or a large pile of debris. Counts as 5 snakes.
Solid Note.MOD	DESC:You give temporary physical form to a single musical note and can hang it, suspended, wherever you wish within range, allowing you to use it as hook, pulley, door blocker, or anything else your imagination desires. The exact appearance of the solid note depends on your melody. You can make it spiked or smooth, simple or convoluted, and with any color pattern you wish, however, it always has a size approximately equal to that of your outstretched hand. Once created, the solid note resists all attempts to move it but instantly disappears if enough force or weight is brought to bear against it. The note has an effective Strength equal to 10 + your caster level. It cannot hold more weight than the equivalent of a heavy load for its Strength without disappearing. Any creature that wins an opposed Strength check against the note (by pushing open a door which the note is holding shut for example) also causes it to disappear. The note can never deal actual harm to a creature and disappears if successfully attacked (AC 10 + your Charisma modifier) or overcome with a combat maneuver such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any creature obstructed by the solid note simply fails to budge it and loses that action for the round.
Spark.MOD	DESC:You can make an unattended Fine flammable object catch on fire. This works as if you were using flint and steel except that you can use spark in any sort of weather and it takes much less time to actually ignite an object.
Spiked Pit.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as create pit, except that the pit is lined with wickedly sharp spikes along its bottom and walls and has a maximum depth of 50 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal, plus 2d6 points of piercing damage from the spikes. Any creature or object coming into contact with the spikes along the walls, such as a creature trying to climb out, or rope or other typical aids to climbing, takes 1d6 points of piercing damage each round they are in contact with the walls. For those willing to accept the damage incurred while climbing, the pit's walls have a Climb DC of 20.
Spiritual Ally.MOD	DESC:An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god.  The spiritual ally occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. The spiritual ally carries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for spiritual weapon), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this spell, your spiritual ally can make an attack against a foe within its reach that you designate. The spiritual ally threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The spiritual ally uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the spiritual ally hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect incorporeal creatures.  Each round after the first, you can move the spiritual ally as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet, and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct of force, the spiritual ally cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual ally's AC against touch attacks is 10.  If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual ally strikes it. If the ally is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
Spite.MOD	DESC:Choose a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower with a casting time of 1 standard action or less. As part of the action of casting spite, you cast the associated spell and bind it into a defensive ward in the form of a tattoo, birthmark, or wart somewhere upon your body. The next time you are hit by a melee attack or a combat maneuver is used successfully against you, the stored spell is triggered against your foe. You do not need to succeed on a touch attack to affect the target, but in all other respects the spell is treated as though you had cast it normally. If the attacking creature is not a valid target for the spell, the stored spell is lost with no effect.  You can have only one spite spell in effect at a time; if you cast this spell a second time, the previous spell effect ends.
Stay the Hand.MOD	DESC:You cause a creature's arm to waver and prevent it from striking another creature. You can cast this spell when the target is about to make a melee attack against another creature. On a failed saving throw, the target does not follow through with its attack, and its entire action is wasted for the round. On a successful saving throw, the target can make its attack, forcing its strike though the compulsion but losing both accuracy and power, taking a -5 penalty on its attack and damage rolls. Whether or not the target makes its initial save or not, it is subject to a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the creature it originally targeted for the duration of the spell.
Stone Call.MOD	DESC:A rain of dirt, gravel, and small pebbles fills the area, dealing 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage to every creature in the area. This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast.  For the remaining duration of the spell, this debris covers the ground, making the entire area difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the rocks disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).
Stone Fist.MOD	DESC:This spell transforms your hands into living stone. While this spell is in effect, your unarmed strikes do not provoke attacks of opportunity and deal 1d6 points of lethal bludgeoning damage (1d4 if you are Small). In addition, your unarmed strikes ignore the hardness of any object with a hardness less than 8.  Stone to flesh immediately dispels stone fist. Should you be the target of transmute rock to mud, this spell immediately ends and you take 4d6 points of damage.
Stormbolts.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, lightning spills forth from your body in all directions. The bolts do not harm natural vegetation or creatures in the area you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creatures within the area take 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d8) and are stunned for 1 round. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the stun effect.
Strong Jaw.MOD	DESC:Laying a hand upon an allied creature's jaw, claws, tentacles, or other natural weapons, you enhance the power of that creature's natural attacks. Each natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the creature were two sizes larger than it actually is (see page 302 of the Pathfinder Bestiary for more information). If the creature is already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized, double the amount of damage dealt by each of its natural attacks instead. This spell does not actually change the creature's size; all of its statistics except the amount of damage dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged.
Stumble Gap.MOD	DESC:You create a shallow extradimensional hole perfectly sized to trip anyone who steps within it. This hole occupies a single 5-foot square with a depth of six inches. Any creature occupying the square when you first create the hole, or who later steps into the square containing the hole, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling prone in an adjacent square and taking 1d6 points of damage. A creature that makes its saving throw still stumbles ever so slightly and takes a -1 penalty on all rolls and checks for 1 round. The spell has no effect on creatures adjacent to the square containing the hole.
Stunning Finale.MOD	DESC:You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell.  With a flourish, you immediately end your bardic performance, assaulting the senses of the targets with your finale. Each target is stunned for 1 round. On a successful saving throw, a target is staggered for 1 round.
Suffocation.MOD	DESC:This spell extracts the air from the target's lungs, causing swift suffocation. The target can attempt to resist this spell's effects with a Fortitude save-if he succeeds, he is merely staggered for 1 round as he gasps for breath. If the target fails, he immediately begins to suffocate. On the target's next turn, he falls unconscious and is reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the target drops to -1 hit points and is dying. One round after that, the target dies. Each round, the target can delay that round's effects from occurring by making a successful Fortitude save, but the spell effect continues for 3 rounds, and each time a target fails his Fortitude save, he moves one step further along the track to suffocation. This spell only affects living creatures that must breathe. It is impossible to defeat the effects of this spell by simply holding one's breath-if the victim fails the initial saving throw, the air in his lungs is extracted.
Suffocation (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as suffocation except as noted above. Note that the duration of this spell is much longer, forcing those suffering from the effect to make far more Fortitude saves to stave off eventual suffocation.
Summon Eidolon.MOD	DESC:You open a rift between dimensions that summons your eidolon.  Treat this as if you had summoned your eidolon normally, except that it only remains with you for the duration of this spell. While summoned in this way, your eidolon cannot touch any creature warded by protection from evil or a similar effect and your eidolon can be sent back to its home plane by dispel magic.  If you cast this spell while your eidolon is already on your plane, this spell has no effect. This spell allows you to summon your eidolon even if it has been returned to its home plane due to damage.
Swarm Skin.MOD	DESC:You convert all of your soft tissue into swarms of insects or other creatures and send them off to do your bidding, leaving nothing but your bones and gear behind. These swarms have all their normal qualities and abilities but also bear a tiny portion of your consciousness that allows you to perceive what they do and to control their actions. While in this form, you cannot use any of your own abilities or take any actions other than controlling the swarms.  Each time you cast this spell you get a total allotment of levels equal to your caster level and any swarm you choose to create costs one or more of those levels. You can “spend” your allotment of levels to create any combination of swarms so long as their total does not exceed your caster level: 2 caster levels Spider swarm (Pathfinder Bestiary page 258), 4 caster levels Rat swarm (Bestiary 232), 6 caster levels Crab swarm, wasp swarm (Bestiary 50, 275), 8 caster levels Centipede swarm, leech swarm (Bestiary 43, 187), 10 caster levels Army ant swarm (Bestiary 16).  Once you create these swarms they remain in existence until destroyed or you order them to return to your body. When all swarms have returned to your body or are destroyed, your flesh wraps itself back around your bones and you regain the ability to act normally. If your bones are not where you left them you must first locate them in order to regain access to your body. You always know if your bones are destroyed and your consciousness remains in control of the swarms until they too are destroyed (and your die). If you can use the swarms to get help and arrange for someone to repair your bones (using anything that would normally restore you to life), at which point you can return the swarms to your body.

#Block: T, U
Thorn Body.MOD	DESC:This spell causes spines to grow from your exposed skin, damaging creatures that strike you. Any creature striking you with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures using melee weapons with reach are unaffected by this spell. Creatures that successfully grapple you take 2d6 points of piercing damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, your natural attacks and unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage.  Thorns created by this spell persist through any new physical shape or form you assume, such as via wildshape or any polymorph effect.
Threefold Aspect.MOD	DESC:Threefold aspect allows you to shift your appearance between your natural age and three idealized age categories: young adult (youth/maiden), adulthood (father/mother), or elderly (elder/crone). In each case, your appearance is your own at the appropriate age, rather than that of a new individual.  You may change between these three aspects or your actual age as a standard action. As the young adult, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Constitution, but suffer a -2 penalty to Wisdom. In the adult aspect, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Intelligence, but take a -2 penalty to Dexterity. As the elderly aspect, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Intelligence, but take a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. As enhancement bonuses, these stack with any bonuses or penalties you may have from your actual age (which are untyped bonuses)-the bonuses granted by this spell represent your idealized form in this threefold aspect rather than simply duplicating your ability scores at any one particular age.  True seeing reveals your natural appearance overlaid with that your aspect, recognizing both as part of your true self.  Individuals who study you closely and have interacted with you at another apparent age recognize a resemblance (as though family) with a successful DC 20 Perception check.  Threefold aspect does not alter your clothing or equipment, and does not heal any deformity or injury unrelated to age.
Thundering Drums.MOD	DESC:You strike the ground in front of you, filling the area in front of you with the thunder of pounding drums. Any creature in the area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 5d8) and is knocked prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates being knocked prone.
Timely Inspiration.MOD	DESC:A word of arcane-empowered inspiration can snatch victory from seeming defeat. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll or skill check. The target gains a +1 competence bonus per five caster levels (maximum +3 bonus) on the attack roll or skill check retroactively. If the bonus is enough to make the failure a success, the roll succeeds.
Tireless Pursuers.MOD	DESC:This spell functions as tireless pursuit, except as noted above.
Tireless Pursuit.MOD	DESC:You harden your body against the stresses of long travel. You halve the damage caused by hustling and forced marching (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 171). In addition, for the duration of the spell you ignore any fatigue caused by such travel. Once the spell ends, if you still have any nonlethal damage caused by the hustling or forced march, you become fatigued, or exhausted if already fatigued.
Touch of Gracelessness.MOD	DESC:With a single touch, you reduce a creature to a fumbling clown.  The target takes a penalty to its Dexterity equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). This penalty cannot drop the target's Dexterity score below 1.  In addition, if the subject moves more than half its speed, it falls prone. If the subject flies, its maneuverability is reduced by one step (perfect maneuverability becomes good, good becomes average, and so on).  A successful Fortitude save halves the penalty to Dexterity and negates the possibility of falling prone or the reduction to fly maneuverabilities.
Touch of the Sea.MOD	DESC:You cause webs to grow between the target's fingers and its feet to transform into flippers, granting a swim speed of 30 feet along with the standard +8 bonus on Swim checks and the ability to take 10 even if distracted or endangered. You can also use the run action while swimming, provided you swim in a straight line. This transformation causes any boots or gloves the target is wearing to meld into its form (although magic items with a continuous effect continue to function). This spell does not grant the target any ability to breathe water.
Transmogrify.MOD	DESC:Your eidolon's form shifts and transforms. This spell allows you to change any of the eidolon's evolutions by allocating its evolution pool on new evolutions. If you have the aspect or greater aspect ability, this spell also allows you to change the evolution points spent to modify you, including removing or adding points as allowed by those abilities.  Your eidolon cannot benefit from this spell more than once per day. This spell does not allow you to change your eidolon's base form. Transmute Potion to Poison.MOD	DESC:This extract causes you to take on a pale, sickly pallor for 1 round. During this time, if you consume a potion, it has no effect. Instead, your mouth fills with a vile poison that you can spit onto a weapon as a free action. If you do not spit out the poison in 1 round, it affects you instead. The effect of the poison depends on the level of spell contained in the potion consumed (see sidebar). If the poison is not used within 1 minute per caster level it becomes inert. You can only create one dose of poison in this way per casting of this spell.  The following poisons are created through the transmute potion to poison spell. The power of the poison depends on the level of the spell contained in the transmuted potion.  0-Level Potion Poison: injury, Fortitude DC 10, 1/round for 2 rounds, 1 Dex damage, Cure 1 save.  1st-Level Potion Poison: injury, Fortitude DC 11, 1/round for 4 rounds, 1d2 Dex damage, Cure 1 save.  2nd-Level Potion Poison: injury, Fortitude DC 13, 1/round for 6 rounds, 1d4 Str damage, Cure 1 save.  3rd-Level Potion Poison: injury, Fortitude DC 14, 1/round for 6 rounds, 1d4 Con damage, Cure 2 consecutive saves.
Treasure Stitching.MOD	DESC:You can transform all objects placed on a cloth into an embroidered, two-dimensional representation, making it easy for you to store and transport the items. You can pile any amount or weight of objects on the cloth so long as the pile stays within the dimensions of the cloth (up to a 10-foot cube).  When you cast the spell the entire pile disappears into the cloth, replaced by a highly accurate, sewn picture of the pile from whatever angle you wish. The cloth retains its normal weight and dimensions. You can restore the pile of objects at any time as a full-round action by unfurling the cloth and ordering the spell to end, consuming the cloth. Anyone else wishing to restore the objects must successfully dispel your spell. If the cloth is destroyed or significantly damaged, all objects held within the cloth are lost. This spell cannot affect artifacts or other sorts of similarly unique objects.
True Form.MOD	DESC:True form removes any polymorph effect from a target creature, returning it to its true form, even against its will. Against creatures affected by polymorph spell effects (such as baleful polymorph or giant form), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the polymorph effect immediately ends.  A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope) must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, the spell ends and the creature is capable of changing shape once again. If the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from changing its shape.
Tsunami.MOD	DESC:You create a massive wave of water that then moves in a straight line across water or land-you select the direction the wave travels (which must be perpendicular to its width), but once set in motion, the wave cannot change course. Over the surface of open water, the wave travels at a speed of 60 feet per round-on land or underwater, the wave travels at a speed of 30 feet per round.  Creatures struck by a tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage).  In addition, the tsunami makes a special CMB check against any creature it strikes-the wave's CMB is equal to your caster level + your relevant spellcasting ability score modifier (whichever is highest) + 8 (for the wave's size). If this CMB check defeats a creature's CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave's CMB check-if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half ) and continues being carried along by the wave.  Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave's journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space-if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Freedom of movement prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature.  A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.
Twilight Knife.MOD	DESC:You create a darkly sinister floating knife that attacks the same creature as you each round. If you choose not to attack a creature, or you make an attack that affects multiple opponents, the knife makes no attack during that round.  The knife uses your base attack bonus modified by either your Intelligence or Charisma bonus (whichever is higher) when making this attack. Unless you specifically will it to do otherwise, or it proves impossible to do so, the knife always maneuvers itself so that it can flank your opponent before making the attack. The knife deals 1d4 points of force damage on a successful hit and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a normal dagger. In addition, if the target is denied a Dexterity bonus to AC or the knife flanks the target, the knife can make sneak attacks as a rogue, inflicting an extra 1d6 points of force damage per four caster levels on a successful attack.  A twilight knife cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A twilight knife's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object) plus your Dexterity modifier.  If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the twilight knife strikes it. If the knife is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
Twin Form.MOD	DESC:This extract splits a perfect double of yourself from your body, dressed and equipped exactly as you are. You are able to shift your consciousness from one body to the other once each round as a free action. This shift takes place either immediately before your turn or immediately after it, but not during the round. You may act normally in the body you inhabit. Your other self is treated as though dazed, except it may take a single move action each round during your turn. Your twin cannot speak while you are in your other body, and cannot flank, make attacks of opportunity, or otherwise threaten enemies.  Both you and your twin have the same statistics and start with the number of hit points you had when you ingested the extract. Once you have split, these hit points are tracked separately. Any spells, extracts, or magical effects (such as from potions) that were active when you ingested the extract are active for both you and your twin. If any such effects expire, are dispelled, dismissed, or otherwise used or ended, they end for both of you. Extracts or spells cast after you split affect you and your twin as though you were two separate targets. Your equipment is linked between your two selves, and if an item on one is consumed or destroyed, its duplicate is used up or destroyed as well.  The body you do not inhabit crumbles into dust when the extract's duration expires or is dismissed. If the body you inhabit is destroyed, you immediately shift to your surviving self and the extract immediately ends. The body you left behind crumbles into dust, and you are stunned until the start of your next turn. If the body you do not inhabit is destroyed, the extract also ends immediately, but you suffer no ill effects.  You have no special ability to sense what your second body is experiencing, though you immediately know if it has been destroyed. You may switch between bodies at any distance on the same plane. If your bodies cross into separate planes (including through the use of teleport or blink), the body you inhabit survives, while your other body is destroyed.
Unfetter.MOD	DESC:This spell breaks the life link between you and your eidolon. This spell allows your eidolon to venture more than 100 feet away from you without penalty. It can travel any distance while this spell is in effect without penalty, but if the spell expires while the eidolon is farther than 100 feet away, it immediately loses hit points as normal for distance and is possibly sent back to its home plane. While this spell is in effect, you cannot sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to your eidolon. Damage that would be transferred due to the life bond ability is not transferred. If you attempt to use the transposition ability while this spell is in effect, you must roll on the teleport mishap table, using the “studied carefully” row.
Universal Formula.MOD	DESC:As you ingest this extract, it transforms into the appropriate extract for any formula you know of 3rd level or lower and takes effect immediately. If the chosen formula has an expensive material component, it must be provided along with the component for this formula. You may not create an infused extract with this formula.
Unwilling Shield.MOD	DESC:Like shield other, unwilling shield creates a mystic connection between you and the target, but unlike shield other, the target shares the wounds that you receive. In addition, the link draws upon the target's life force to supplement your own defenses. You gain a +1 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. You take only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by you is taken by the target. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, ability damage, level draining, and death effects are not affected. If you take a reduction in hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the target because it is not hit point damage.  When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the subject, but damage already split is not assigned to you.  If you and the target of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell remains active, but damage is no longer shared until you are once again within range of each other.
Unwitting Ally.MOD	DESC:You befuddle the target's mind. The target has difficulty telling friend from foe for a short period of time. The subject is considered your ally and not your enemies' ally while determining flanking. The subject takes no other hostile action against your enemies due to this spell's effect.

#Block: V, W
Vanish.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like invisibility, except the effect only lasts for 1 round per caster level (maximum of 5 rounds). Like invisibility, the spell immediately ends if the subject attacks any creature.
Veil of Positive Energy.MOD	DESC:You surround yourself with a veil of positive energy, making it harder for undead creatures to harm you. When under the effect of this spell, you gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC and a+2 sacred bonus on saves. Both of these bonuses apply only against attacks or effects created by undead creatures. You can dismiss this spell before its normal duration as a swift action on your turn to deal a number of points of positive energy damage equal to your level to all undead creatures within 5 feet of you.
Venomous Bolt.MOD	DESC:You infuse a single arrow or crossbow bolt with natural venom as you fire it. In addition to its normal damage, anyone struck by this arrow or bolt is affected as if by the poison spell. If the arrow is not fired immediately, the spell ends with no effect.
Versatile Weapon.MOD	DESC:You transform the physical makeup of a weapon as you desire.  This spell functions like greater magic weapon, except that it subtly alters the physical properties of a weapon, enabling it to bypass damage reduction of one the following types: bludgeoning, cold iron, piercing, silver, or slashing. The affected weapon still inflicts damage of its normal type and its hardness and hit points are unchanged. This spell can be cast on a natural weapon or unarmed strike.
Vomit Swarm.MOD	DESC:You vomit forth a swarm of spiders (Bestiary, page 258) that attacks all other creatures within its area. The swarm begins adjacent to you, but if no living creatures are within its area, it moves in one direction of your choosing at its normal speed.  You can move the swarm or change the swarm's direction by spending a standard action to concentrate on the swarm, otherwise it continues moving in its current direction. If your caster level is at least 7th, you can vomit forth a swarm of wasps instead (Bestiary 275). Finally, if your caster level is at least 13th, you can vomit forth a swarm of army ants (Bestiary 16).
Vortex.MOD	DESC:You create a powerful and immobile whirlpool in any body of liquid large enough to contain the spell's effect. Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be pulled into the whirlpool and held suspended in its powerful currents, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed.  You may direct the whirlpool to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish. A boat that is equal in length or shorter than the vortex's width that passes through a vortex takes 6d6 points of damage and is caught up by the current. If the boat's captain makes a DC 25 Profession (sailor) check (or if the boat is longer than the vortex's width), the boat takes only half damage and is not caught up by the vortex.
Wake of Light.MOD	DESC:You and your mount lay down a trail of glowing, heavenly mist behind you as you move that makes passage easier for good creatures but more difficult for evil creatures. This glowing trail of mist appears behind your mount in a straight line starting where you cast the spell and ending where your mount ends its movement. The mist takes the form of a path 10 feet wide and up to 120 feet long and always floats just above the ground, up to a height of 1 foot. Thereafter, the mist persists for 1 round per level.  Good creatures may walk along the top of the mist as if it were solid, treating squares of difficult terrain containing the mist as normal terrain. Evil creatures find the mist thick and cloying, and treat squares of normal terrain containing the mist as difficult terrain instead. Neutral creatures pass through the mist with no effect. The mist has no effect on obstacles or otherwise impassable terrain, and does not block sight or provide concealment.  Except for very special circumstances (such as a celestial or fiendish mount), mounts use the alignment of their rider when determining how this spell affects them. You must be mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you dismount, get knocked off, or take any other action that separates you from your mount, the spell immediately ends, although the mist remains for the spell's normal duration.  A wake of light cannot follow across water, underwater, or through the air in the case of a mount capable of walking on water, swimming, or flight.
Wall of Lava.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a vertical wall of lava that is 1 inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. A wall of lava's maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a wall of lava can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall's overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a wall of lava, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack).  A creature can move through a wall of lava as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check-failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a wall of lava inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A wall of lava also radiates heat as if it were a wall of fire, although the heat from a wall of lava radiates from both sides.  Once per round as a move action, you can direct the wall of lava to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall's overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a wall of lava from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.  All damage inflicted by physical contact with a wall of lava continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).
Wall of Suppression.MOD	DESC:You create a wall of glittering motes that suppresses or even negates any magical effect passing through it. The wall appears to have no actual substance and does not physically obstruct or impede anything attempting to move through it. However, the wall exerts a powerful anti-magical effect.  Any magic item or magical spell or effect of your caster level or lower that passes through the wall is suppressed for 1 round per level. Spells or effects with durations expire normally, even while thus suppressed. A spell or effect with a duration greater than that of the suppression effect resumes functioning normally when the suppression ends.  The wall affects all magical effects, including spells, spelllike abilities, magical items, and any effects stemming from them that pass through the wall. The wall does not suppress a creature's ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration.  The wall blocks line of effect, so no spell or effect can pass through the wall, but it does not block line of sight. Magic items or spell effects with a higher caster level than yours are unaffected by the wall of suppression. The wall does not affect artifacts, anything stemming from the direct action of a deity, or similarly powerful sorts of magic.
Wandering Star Motes.MOD	DESC:You create sparkling motes of bright light that shoot toward the target and swirl around it in a complex pattern. The pattern clearly outlines the target and radiates light as if it were a sunrod, negating any concealment for the target. The target must make a successful Will save. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round and must make another save on its next turn or be dazed again for 1 round. The target must continue making Will saves each round. If a target makes its Will save, the wandering star motes jump to the nearest enemy within 30 feet, who must now make Will saves every round or be dazed. Any time a target makes its Will save, the wandering star motes jump to the next nearest enemy within 30 feet.  A given creature can only be affected by the wandering star motes once; once a target has successfully saved against the spell, it cannot be affected again. If there are no new targets within 30 feet of a target that has successfully made its save, the spell immediately ends. The spell only affects enemy creatures; your allies are not affected.
Ward the Faithful.MOD	DESC:All creatures within the area who worship the same god as you gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on all saves. At 12th level, these bonuses increase to +3. At 18th level, the bonuses increase to +4.  If you do not worship a specific deity, the bonuses apply to those who share your faith. If you do not have a specific faith or religion, the spell provides benefits only to yourself. Enemies gain the benefits of this spell if they worship the same god or share the same faith as you, even if you view them as heretical.
Weapon of Awe.MOD	DESC:You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no saving throw.  This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its ammunition.  You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you can cast it on an unarmed strike.
Winds of Vengeance.MOD	DESC:You surround yourself with a buffeting shroud of supernatural, tornado-force winds. These winds grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. Neither your armor nor your load affects this fly speed. The winds shield you from any other wind effects, and form a shell of breathable air around you, allowing you to fly and breathe underwater or in outer space.  Ranged weapons (including giant-thrown boulders, siege weapon projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons) passing through the winds are deflected by the winds and automatically miss you. Gases and most gaseous breath weapons cannot pass though the winds.  In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can shape your winds so they lash out at that creature as an immediate action. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw or take 5d8 points of bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (if on the ground). On a failed save, Huge flying creatures are checked and Large-sized or smaller flying creatures are blown away instead of knocked prone (see page 439 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for more information).  On a successful save, the damage is halved and the creature is not knocked prone (or checked or blown away).
World Wave.MOD	DESC:You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert, tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.  When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell).  The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM's discretion.  The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave's crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.  The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).  You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.
Wrath.MOD	DESC:You focus your anger against an enemy. Choose one enemy creature that you can see. You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against that designated creature for every three caster levels you have (at least +1, maximum +3). You also receive this bonus on caster level checks made to overcome the creature's spell resistance, if any. At 12th level, you gain the benefits of the Improved Critical feat on attack rolls made against the designated creature. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.
Wrathful Mantle.MOD	DESC:A shimmering mantle of light shrouds the subject, casting light like a torch. The subject of the spell gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). The subject can end the wrathful mantle at any time as a swift action to deal 2d8 points of force damage to all creatures within 5 feet.

The target genuinely believes that the idea is his own, but is not required to act upon it. If the idea is contrary to the target's normal thoughts (such as making a paladin think, "I should murder my friends") the target may suspect mind-altering magic is at play. The idea must be fairly clear, enough so that it can be conveyed in one or two sentences. You do not need to share a common language for the spell to succeed, but without a common language you can only sow the most basic rudimentary ideas.

As a swift action, the target can cause the ground to rise 5 feet, while all adjacent squares are treated as steep slopes. The groundswell precludes flanking from creatures standing at lower elevations than the target. If the target moves after creating a groundswell, the ground returns to its normal elevation at the end of his turn; otherwise, it remains in place until the target moves or uses a swift action to return the ground to normal. A groundswell cannot increase elevation of the ground beyond 5 feet.

The ironbeard grants a +1 armor bonus to AC, and this bonus stacks with any armor worn by the creature. The ironbeard may also be used as a weapon equivalent to cold iron armor spikes. The ironbeard makes it difficult to speak, so any spellcasting with a verbal component has a 20%% spell failure chance.

This grants you a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks and allows you to make Stealth checks without cover or concealment, but only while you move no more than half your base speed or less. If you move more than half your base speed on your turn, you gain no benefit from this spell until the start of your next turn. If you make an attack, this spell ends (as invisibility).

This spell has one of four different effects. The caster of the spell can select any one of the following four effects, but can change the effect as a standard action that reduces the total remaining duration by 1 hour. Spring: The target is wrapped in light vines, culminating in a crown of bright, beautiful flowers. While the spell remains in effect, the target is immune to bleed effects and regains 1 hit point per round whenever below 0 hit points, as long as the target is still alive. This stabilizes the target. For each hit point restored in this way, the spell's total remaining duration is reduced by 1 hour. Summer: The target is surrounded by tiny motes of light. While the spell remains in effect, the target's base speed increases 10 feet. The target may instead increase its base speed by 30 feet for 1 round by reducing the spell's total remaining duration by 1 hour. Fall: A cloak of autumn leaves appears on the target. While the spell remains in effect, the target gains a +2 morale bonus on Fortitude saves. The target can decide to roll twice on any saving throw against disease or poison and take the higher result by reducing the spell's total remaining duration by 1 hour. Winter: A flutter of snow and crisp air surrounds the target. While this spell remains in effect, the target automatically succeeds at Acrobatics skill checks made to avoid falling while moving across slick or narrow surfaces. The target can move freely through difficult terrain for 1 round by reducing the spell's remaining duration by 1 hour. Difficult terrain created by magic affects the target normally.
Whispering Lore	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Witch=1|Cleric=2	SCHOOL:Divination	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 full-round action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Elf%,RACESUBTYPE=Elf]	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/coreRaces/elves.html#_whispering-lore	DESC:Upon casting this spell, you are able to gain knowledge from the land itself. As you walk through the terrain, it whispers information in a language you understand, though the whispering is so rambling it is hard to distinguish useful information. This whispering grants you a +4 insight bonus on a single Knowledge skill type appropriate to the type of terrain you are in. If you are within a cold, desert, forest, jungle, mountain, plains, swamp, or water environment, you gain the bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks. If you are within an underground environment, you gain the bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks. If you are within an urban environment, you gain the bonus on Knowledge (local) checks. If you are on a plane other than the Material Plane, you gain the bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks. If you enter a new terrain, you lose the previous terrain's skill bonus and gain the new bonus.

In addition, a creature affected by this spell awakens with no knowledge of the events that led to the spell's casting. The target loses all memory from the 5 minutes prior to falling asleep. No effect short of a miracle or wish can restore memories lost by this spell.

Unlike with most polymorph effects, your basic form does not change, so you keep all extraordinary and supernatural abilities of your half-elven form as well as all of your gear. For the duration of the spell, you receive a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence and are treated as if you possessed any one feat for which you meet the prerequisites, chosen when you cast this spell.
Resilient Reservoir	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Magus,Paladin=3|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:See Description	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Reflex half	SPELLRES:Yes	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Half-Elf]	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/coreRaces/halfElves.html#_resilient-reservoir	DESC:This spell creates a magical well of retribution that a caster can unleash with blinding speed. Upon casting this spell, damage from melee attacks and touch spells gets transferred into a special pool that you then redirect before the spell's duration expires. Each time you are struck by a melee attack or touch spell that deals hit point damage, 1 point of damage is negated and transferred into the reservoir created by this spell. The total number of points in the reservoir cannot exceed your caster level (to a maximum of 20 points at 20th level). As an immediate action, anytime before the spell's duration expires, you can release some or all of the energy of the reservoir, granting yourself an insight bonus on one skill check, attack roll, damage roll, or combat maneuver check, but you must do so before the roll is made. This bonus is equal to the number of points in the reservoir. For every five caster levels, you may call upon the reservoir one additional time (maximum of four times at 15th level). If you are reduced to negative hit points while you are under the effect of this spell, the spell automatically release the remaining magic of the reservoir in a concussive blast of force. All creatures within a 15-foot radius take 1d6 points of force damage per 2 points remaining in the reserve (maximum of 10d6). A successful Reflex save halves this damage, and spell resistance applies to this effect.
Urban Grace	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Ranger,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Half-Elf]	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/coreRaces/halfElves.html#_urban-grace	DESC:You become one with the city around you, allowing you to move more easily through its crowds and buildings. For the duration of this spell, your base land speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, it does not cost you 2 squares of movement to enter a square with crowds, though the crowd still provides cover to you. This ability does not allow you to enter the space of enemy creatures without making the appropriate Acrobatics check. In addition, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move across uneven urban surfaces, such as roofs and broken pavement, and on Climb checks made to scale walls and other artificial surfaces. Whenever you make an Acrobatics check to make a long jump between two buildings or artificial structures, you are always treated as if you had a running start, regardless of the actual distance traveled.

It functions as phantom steed, except as noted above. In addition, the creature radiates an aura of fear. Any creature with fewer than 6 Hit Dice within 30 feet (except the ghost wolf's rider) must make a Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A creature that makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed's fear aura for 24 hours. The ghost wolf may also be used in combat. Once per round, the rider may direct the ghost wolf to attack in battle as a free action (bite +10, 1d8+6 points of damage); unlike an animal mount, this does not require a Ride check or any training. Once the ghost wolf attacks, it lasts for only 1 round per level thereafter.

You gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. If you confirm a critical hit with this attack, it also deals 1 point of bleed damage. If you already have a bite attack, your bite deals 2 points of bleed damage on a critical hit. You are considered proficient with this attack. If used as part of a full-attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack, is made at your full base attack bonus -5, and adds half your Strength modifier to its damage. You can end this spell before its normal duration by making a bestial roar as a swift action. When you do, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within a 30-foot radius that can hear the roar.

You can make the duplicate up to two size categories larger than you are and determine a theme as to how it alters your original appearance. However, this duplicate always retains some vestiges of your actual appearance. Creatures who already know you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to disbelieve this spell. Your duplicate has no actual substance, and you cannot use it to alter its surroundings or to attack or otherwise harm creatures it encounters. You can use the duplicate to speak, and interact verbally with creatures using the Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skills, and you gain a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks when using that skill through the duplicate. You can see, hear, taste, and smell your duplicate's surroundings as if you are actually present using your Perception skill. While you also remain aware of your own immediate surroundings when controlling your duplicate, controlling it does take a toll on your senses. You take a -4 penalty on Perception checks while you control your duplicate. The duplicate moves under your mental command, and while you need not act out its movements, you must take a standard action to control your duplicate for 1 round (concentrating on the spell) or it winks out of existence. You can maintain control of your duplicate even if you have no line of sight or line of effect to it. The duplicate immediately winks out of existence if it is hit by an attack or in the area of a damaging effect, or if it moves beyond the maximum range of the spell.

You must set a few general guidelines when casting the spell as to the nature of this disaster (fire, tornado, bandit raid, plague, etc.), after which the illusion fills in the remaining details to make it seem realistic. When casting the spell, you can grant creatures with particular, clearly identifiable physical traits (race, gender, age category, etc.) immunity to this spell. This allows all such eligible creatures to perceive the true nature of the affected area instead of its illusory appearance. Creatures without this immunity that fail their saving throws always perceive the affected area as having absolutely nothing of interest or worth to them. Unless they have reason for suspicion, they always move on without closely investigating the area. Creatures with sufficient reasons for suspicion who do choose to investigate the area gain another saving throw, this one with a +2 bonus, as they enter the village and directly interact with the illusion. You can expand the area of this spell by casting it multiple times. Each time you do, you must effectively "attach" the spell to the existing area by using the same disaster and granting the same sorts of creatures immunity to its effects. If you fail to do this, the entire illusion, no matter how large, disappears.

For the spell's duration, the target can use any of the following abilities as an immediate action, but only up to a total of nine times, at which point the spell ends. Cat's Luck: The target can use this ability when it fails a saving throw. The target can reroll the failed saving throw, but must take the new result even if it is worse. Fortitude: The target uses this ability when a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against it. The critical hit or sneak attack is negated and the damage is instead rolled normally. Rejuvenate: The target uses this ability when it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The target is instantly healed 3d6 points of damage. If enough hit points are regained to bring the target to positive hit points, it does not fall unconscious. If it is not enough to leave the target with positive hit points, the target automatically stabilizes. Both of these effects work even if the damage was originally enough to kill the target. Shake Off: The target uses this ability when it is under the effects of any of the following conditions: blinded, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, entangled, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, or staggered. Using this ability ends one of those conditions. Shimmy Out: The target uses this ability when it is grappled or pinned. The target automatically escapes the grapple as if it had succeeded at an Escape Artist check to escape the grapple. Stay Up: The target uses this ability when it is tripped or otherwise knocked prone. The target steadies itself and stays upright.

The alignment and personality of the drow are not affected by the transformation, but the spell conceals her alignment as an undetectable alignment spell.

The cloud moves away from you at a rate of 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where the caster cast the spell. Creatures trapped in the webbing remain trapped even after the cloud passes, but the area the cloud leaves behind does not count as difficult terrain. Because the webbing is heavier than air, it sinks to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. The cloud of webbing cannot penetrate liquids,nor can it be cast underwater. The cloud otherwise acts like a web spell. A creature in the cloud at the start of its turn must save against the cloud or be affected. The webbing of this spell is flammable (see the web spell), but has fire resistance 5.

The space holds as many as 10 creatures of any size. When this spell is cast upon a 5-foot-square part of a wall, it creates an extradimensional space adjacent to the Plane of Shadow. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden beyond the reach of spells (including divinations) unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as 10 creatures (of any size). The entrance to the extradimensional space remains visible as an area that is darker than the ambient illumination. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 5-foot-by-5-foot door or window were centered on the affected surface. The window is invisible (though it is within the shadowed entrance to the spell, which is visible), and even creatures that can see the window from the outside can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space is ejected when the spell ends. Only one creature may enter or exit the extradimensional space at a time. The entrance is only open when the area around it is in dim light. Any other level of light (brighter or darker) closes the entrance, trapping creatures inside the extradimensional space. If the entrance is closed when the spell expires, there is a 50%% chance that creatures in it are ejected into the Shadow Plane instead of the location of the entrance. If this occurs, the creatures appear on the Shadow Plane 1d10 miles in a random direction from their corresponding location on the Material Plane. The spell has no effect if cast on a plane that is not adjacent to the Shadow Plane. Because the extradimensional space is adjacent to the Shadow Plane, any shadow walk spell or similar effect that allows travel to the Shadow Plane is more accurate, reducing the distance creatures arrive off-target by half.

The flame does not harm you. During this spell's duration, each time you leave your space, you create a trail of fire that burns within the spaces you move through for 1 round before it burns out. You can leave up to 60 feet of flame trail each round, assuming you are Small or Medium. If you are larger than Medium, the maximum trail length is reduced based on your size. If you are Large, you can leave a trail up to 30 feet long (and 10 feet wide), and if you are Huge, you can leave a trail up to 15 feet long (and 15 feet wide); even larger casters can only leave a trail up to 10 feet long (and as wide as your space) each round. You choose where to leave a flame trail. Creatures that start their turn adjacent to the flame trail take 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that start their turn within the flame trail or that enter an area of flame take a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).

Any creature (including the spell's target) within the aura that takes at least 5 points of piercing, slashing, or bleed damage from a single attack automatically creates a spray of burning blood. The spray strikes a creature in a randomly determined square adjacent to the injured creature. The spray deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature in that square, and 1 point of splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the spray's target, including the target of this spell. A creature can only create one spray of burning blood per round. Creatures that do not have blood (including oozes and most constructs and undead) do not create blood sprays when attacked.

Creatures below half their full hit points or suffering bleed damage are considered strong scents for this ability.

If the target survives, the spell is not wasted and you can try again as long as you continue concentrating on the spell.

The head must be affixed to a pole, spear, tree branch, or other stable object, and the spell ends if the head or its object is moved. The head has darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision, can swivel in place to look in any direction, and has a +5 bonus on Perception checks. If you are within 30 feet of the head, as a standard action you can shift your senses to it, seeing and hearing from its location and gaining the benefit of its darkvision and low-light vision, and you may use its Perception skill instead of your own. While your senses are in the severed head, your body is blind and deaf until you spend a free action to shift your senses back to your own body. When you create the head, you can imprint it with a single triggering condition, similar to magic mouth. Once this triggering condition is set, it can never be changed. If you are within 30 feet of the head, you immediately know if it is triggered (if you have multiple active sentry skulls, you also know which one was triggered). This wakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb your concentration. For example, you could have a sentry skull alert you if any humanoid comes into view, if a particular rival approaches, if your guard animal is killed, and so on, as long as it occurs where the severed head can see it. This spell does not give the head any ability to speak, think, or take any kind of action other than to turn itself, though it is a suitable target for other spells such as magic mouth.

Furthermore, for each 5 feet a creature moves through such areas, it takes 1d6 points of damage. Creatures with a burrow speed or the earth glide ability are unaffected by binding earth.

If the opponent's attack misses you by 4 or less, the attack strikes the shield instead. The stone shield has hardness 8 and 15 hit points.

If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the effect's caster level) to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal air in its place. If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in response. While inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for up to %1 rounds, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration. As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the cloud's original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the breath's area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC.

The sphere is treated in all ways as an area of severe wind, applying a -4 penalty on ranged weapon attacks that pass through it. The sphere moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space containing a Medium or smaller creature, it stops moving for that round and generates a sharp thrust of wind to bull rush the creature. The sphere's CMB for bull rush combat maneuvers uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +2 bonus for its Strength score (14). Whether or not the bull rush is successful, the creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage from the attack. If the bull rush fails, the creature is still subject to the severe winds from the sphere as long as they remain in the same square as it. A gusting sphere rolls over objects or barriers that are less than 4 feet tall. The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest.

Path of the Winds	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=6	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Air	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:100 ft	TARGETAREA:100-ft line 40 ft high	DURATION:Concentration +1 round	SAVEINFO:Fortitude Negates	SPELLRES:Yes	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Sylph%,RACESUBTYPE=Sylph]	SOURCEPAGE:p.161	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/featuredRaces/sylphs.html#_path-of-the-winds	DESC:With a sweeping gesture, you call forth mighty winds to clear a path ahead of you. The winds are the equivalent of a windstorm (Core Rulebook 439). During the first round of the spell, the winds sweep the designated area clear of anything of Small or smaller size, blowing it outward to the sides of the spell's effect (50%% chance of landing on either side). You may move within the effect without penalty, though all other creatures are subject to the wind's effects. On the second and all later rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated as a wind wall. If the effect includes a body of water or other liquid, the winds create a channel up to 40 feet deep into the surface of the liquid. On your turn as a move action, you can move the effect of this spell, either rotating it at one of its ends up to 45 degrees, or moving it up to 50 feet in line with its current orientation (toward you or away from you).

On its turn, the target takes 1d6 points of slashing damage if it moves at least 5 feet, plus 1d6 points of slashing damage for each additional 10 feet of movement. Movement that doesn't pass through air (such as burrowing, swimming, or teleportation) doesn't cause this damage. In areas of strong wind (Core Rulebook 439), the target takes damage on its turn, even if it doesn't move. The wind deals 1d8 points of slashing damage for strong wind, plus 1d8 for every wind category above strong. This extra damage does not occur from instantaneous wind effects (such as gust of wind), only from wind effects that last at least 1 round.

You gain DR 10/magic against this attack and are immune to any poison, sneak attacks, or critical hit effect from that attack. You cannot use windy escape against an attack of opportunity you provoked by casting a spell, using a spelllike ability, or using any other magical ability that provokes an attack of opportunity when used.

Over the next 10 minutes, the birds reply as if you had asked them the question using speak with animals, giving you a general consensus answer to the question based on their knowledge. For example, you could ask if there is drinkable water in the area, the location of predators or other creatures, directions to a mountaintop or other natural feature, and so on, and the local bird communities would answer to the best of their ability. If there are no birds in range, the spell has no effect and you do not get a response. Any creature using speak with animals (or a similar ability) who hears this bird call can understand your question, though it may not be able to reply in a way you can hear.

The target suffers no harm from being in a cold environment, and can exist comfortably in conditions as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. The creature's equipment is likewise protected. This spell doesn't provide any protection from cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards associated with cold weather (such as slipping on ice, blindness from snow, and so on). When you cast this spell, you may have the target's feathers turn white for the duration, granting it a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks to hide in ice and snow.

You choose what type of energy damage the spell deals when you cast it. You attack with your tongue as if it were a whip, except you make touch attacks with it and it can harm creatures with armor or natural armor bonuses. You are considered proficient with this weapon. A successful touch attack with the tongue deals 1d8 points of energy damage per two caster levels (maximum of 5d8 points of damage at 10th level). While the spell is in effect, you cannot speak, cast spells requiring verbal components, or activate items requiring command words. The spell has the acid, electricity, or fire descriptor, depending on what type of energy damage you chose when you cast it.

Nixie's lure affects a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures in the area who fail their saves are lured by the song and move toward you using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures each receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Creatures lured by the spell's song can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of you simply stands still and for the duration of the spell remains fascinated.

If the idea is contrary to the target's normal thoughts (such as making a paladin think, "I should murder my friends") the target may suspect mindaltering magic is at play. The idea must be fairly clear, enough so that it can be conveyed in one or two sentences. You do not need to share a common language for the spell to succeed, but without a common language you can only sow the most basic rudimentary ideas.

The target loses its swim speed but gains a base speed appropriate for a humanoid of its size (speed 30 if a Medium or larger creature, speed 20 if Small). If the creature is immersed in water for 1 round, the transformation reverts, allowing it to swim normally. One round after leaving the water, the transformation occurs again, allowing it to walk. This spell only works on merfolk, tritons, seals, fish, and other creatures whose bodies or limbs are used mainly for swimming and are not suitable for walking.

If protected against fire damage, it can move through lava. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. It requires as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally, but cannot charge or run. Casting move earth on an area containing the target flings the target back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude negates). This spell does not give the target the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through solid material, the creature must hold its breath.

Moving farther than 5 feet from the tether point requires the target to make a bull rush combat maneuver check against a CMB of %1 (if a witch or wizard) or %2 (if a bard or sorcerer). The target takes a -1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing this check means the target's move is wasted and it cannot move farther away.

While under the effect of this spell, you are immune to diseases and poisons with which you come into contact. When you are exposed to a disease or poison, you can choose to absorb it. Doing so ends the immunity due to this spell to any disease and poison other than the one you absorbed. You remain immune to the new affliction until this spell ends. Casting absorb toxicity on yourself a second time does not allow you to absorb a second toxin, but instead resets the duration of the effect to its full (CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes. While you have a disease or poison absorbed, you can use a melee touch attack to transfer that affliction to another creature. A missed attack does not discharge the spell, and you can try to transfer the affliction again in subsequent rounds. If you hit, this spell is discharged, and your target must make a saving throw against the transferred affliction (DC equal to this spell's save DC or the affliction's save DC, whichever is higher) or suffer its effect or initial effect immediately. The target then continues to suffer from the affliction's normal effects. If the spell's duration expires before you have transferred the affliction, you are exposed to any absorbed poison or disease as if you had transferred it to yourself, but you gain a +2 bonus on saves against that particular instance of the poison or disease.

You do not need to supply ammunition for the cannon. On your turn, you can spend a move action to direct the cannon to wheel itself to a new location, moving the cannon up to 20 feet. If the arcane cannon ever leaves your line of sight, it winks out of existence, and the spell's duration ends. The cannon has a range increment of 50 feet. It targets touch attack in the first range increment, and it has no misfire chance. The cannon acts as a weapon with the conductive special weapon ability (see page 286 of the Advanced Player's Guide), which you can use to channel your spell-like or supernatural abilities as long as you are within the range of arcane cannon. The cannon's attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

At the start of each of the target's turns, when it takes bleed damage, it also takes a cumulative -1 penalty on all attack rolls. When that penalty reaches -3, the target also treats all targets as having concealment (20%% miss chance). When the penalty reaches -5, the target is blinded.

This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formulae with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, it creates an invisible cubical prison composed of a solid wall of force. The prison is as large as the splash area of the bomb that you threw, and traps any creature that is entirely inside the area. Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless any creature within the splash radius is too big to fit inside, in which case the effect automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide means for escape, but the force walls extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Like a wall of force, the cage created by the caging bomb admixture resists dispel magic, although a mage's disjunction still functions. The walls of the cage can be damaged by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys the cage. The walls of this cage can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but the cage has a hardness of 20 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per alchemist level. Contact with a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation instantly destroys this cage. When using caging bomb admixture, an alchemist can only have one cage in effect at a time. If the alchemist throws another bomb during the duration of caging bomb admixture, any other cage created by the earlier admixture ends, and a new one is created. When the duration of the caging bomb admixture ends, so does any remaining cage created by this admixture's effect.

This chain is a Medium object that has a 10-foot reach. Physical attacks cannot hit or harm the chain of perdition, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it normally. The chain's AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric). The chain can perform the dirty trick (blind or entangle), drag, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, using your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The chain does not provoke attacks of opportunity for making combat maneuvers. It suffers no penalty or miss chance due to darkness, invisibility, or other forms of concealment. As a move action, you can move the chain up to 30 feet. If the chain goes beyond the spell's range or out of your sight, it returns to you. If a creature that the chain attacks has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the chain performs a successful maneuver against that creature.

When casting the spell, the caster picks a one of the following energy types - acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, or force. The ammunition within the siege weapon now deals that type of energy damage on a hit, though the amount of damage dealt by the ammunition does not change, nor does it change any of the other effects of the ammunition. Unlike other forms of energy damage, this energy damage does full damage to objects. Based on the type of energy the caster chose while casting, the ammunition also gains one of the following effects. Acid - The ammunition deals half its damage in a splash to all creatures and unattended objects within 15 feet of the target hit by the siege engine. Creatures can halve the splash damage with a Reflex saving throw. The DC of the splash is the same as the DC of the spell. Cold - The ammunition creates an ice sheen within a 20-footradius burst around the target of the siege engine's attack. That sheen lasts 1d6 rounds. Creatures within the ice sheen are entangled. Any creature within the area of the ice sheen at the start of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage. Electricity - Creatures hit by the siege engine attack or within 15 feet of the attack are staggered for 1 round. Fire - Creatures and wood objects within 15 feet of the attack may catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444 and page 164 of this book).

Use your caster level as your Combat Maneuver Bonus, adding your Charisma modifier (bard, oracle, sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (magus, wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. This combat maneuver attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from its target, but casting this spell might. If you are successful, you pull the target object to you, and if you have enough hands free, you can catch it. Otherwise, the object lands in your square as if you dropped it. Careful Maneuver - You attempt a Disable Device check or a Sleight of Hand check to pick-pocket a target within range. This spell lasts as long as you need to accomplish the task, requiring your full concentration for that duration. Once you resolve the skill check, the spell ends.

While in this form, the target has only 1 HD (maximum hit points), and the target takes a -4 penalty to Strength, Constitution, Intelligence and Wisdom (minimum 1). The creature also gains a +4 size bonus to Dexterity and a +2 natural bonus. Any nonevil creature that attempts to attack a creature in this form must succeed at a Will saving throw (using the DC of the spell) to overcome feelings of guilt and protectiveness toward the young and innocent-seeming creature. On a failed saving throw, it cannot follow through with the attack, that part of the action is lost, and it can't directly attack the transformed creature for the duration of the spell or until the spell's target attacks it. This part of the spell is a mind-affecting emotion effect. Evil creatures have no qualms about attacking the target of this spell, in fact, some particularly heinous creatures might go out of their ways to do the target harm.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a rag doll)

You gain DR 5/piercing, as well as a +4 circumstance bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts and on saving throws against effects that cause you to drop something you are holding. Additionally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to initiate a grapple, maintain a grapple, and pin a foe. Any enemy you grapple takes a -2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape the grapple using Escape Artist. Any weapon, that strikes you becomes stuck unless its wielder succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. Such a weapon can be pulled free of you only with a successful Strength check (DC = your saving throw DC for this spell). This spell has no effect on unarmed strikes or natural weapons.

When the wielder ricochets a projectile, she selects a primary target to attack. If she hits the primary target, the projectile ricochets instead of being destroyed. The wielder can then select a secondary target that is within 20 feet of the primary target. She makes an attack roll against the secondary target at the same base attack bonus, but does not gain the benefit from any enhancement bonuses or magic qualities on the projectile. If the shot comes from a firearm, the ricochet targets normal AC rather than touch AC. While the spell lasts, the target weapon's wielder can ricochet one projectile per three caster levels you possess, to a maximum of six at caster level 18th. Once the target weapon's wielder ricochets that many shots, the spell is discharged. If the weapon's wielder fails to use all the ricochets before the spell end, those ricochets are wasted.

This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, a shadowy substance is released from the bomb covering the direct target and up to three creatures that take damage from the bomb's splash (alchemist's choice). The affected creatures must successfully make a Fortitude saving throw, or they gain concealment but treat all other creatures as having concealment for the duration of the shadow bomb admixture. This effect does not ignore spell resistance.

This shield hovers in front of you and negates magic missile attacks directed at you. The disk provides a +2 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks. At any time, as a free action, you may dismiss your shield, at which point it deals 1d6 points of electrical damage to all creatures within a 5-foot burst, including you.

Each plant targeted acts as a light catapult (see page 162) until the end of the spell's duration, though you must spend a standard action to aim each of these tree catapults before the first time they fire, and anytime thereafter when you want the trees to fire at a new target. The catapult ues your caster level as its targeting bonus. With a free action, you can command one or all of the trees under your command to stop firing. You do not need to supply ammunition to these tree catapults; they will automatically load themselves with rocks and boulders in the area, digging them deep from the ground if need be. You can supply the trees ammunition if you desire. The tree will not load flaming ammunition, and these catapult trees cannot be affected by energy siege shot (see page 228) if the energy selected is fire.

When triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around it as if it were a Medium creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you used as the material component.

Telekinetic Charge	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Force	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one willing creature	DURATION:instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.247	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/telekineticCharge.html#_telekinetic-charge-	DESC:You telekinetically launch an ally across the battlefield to anywhere within this spell's range. While moving, your ally is flying just above the ground unless you wish otherwise. Movement from this spell provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, although you can lift your ally over objects or out of enemy reach, as long as your ally remains within this spell's range. If your ally lands adjacent to an opponent, he can spend an immediate action to make a melee attack against that opponent with a +2 bonus on the attack roll.

You treat the terrain you are in as your most favored terrain until this spell ends. If you do not have the favored terrain class feature, you gain no benefit from this spell.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a pinch of earth taken from your most favored terrain)
Thunder Fire	CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:1 loaded firearm	DURATION:instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object), see text	SPELLRES:Yes (object), see text	SOURCEPAGE:p.247	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/thunderFire.html#_thunder-fire	DESC:The firearm targeted creates a thunderous report, even if the firearm is not loaded. Every creature within 15 feet of the creature wielding or carrying the firearm must succeed at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The creature wielding or carrying the firearm takes a -4 penalty on this saving throw, and his misfire range increases by 1 for 1d4 rounds. If the firearm was loaded when it was targeted by this spell, that ammunition is wasted.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a piece of spent thunderstone)
Tongues (Communal)	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard=3|Alchemist,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4|Cleric=5	SCHOOL:Divination	COMPS:V, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	ITEM:Potion	TARGETAREA:creatures touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:No	SOURCEPAGE:p.247	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/tongues.html#_tongues,-communal	DESC:This spell functions like tongues, except you divide the duration in 10-minute intervals among the creatures touched.
Touch Injection	CLASSES:Alchemist=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	SOURCEPAGE:p.247	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/touchInjection.html#_touch-injection	DESC:You must hold an elixir, infused extract, poison, or potion in hand as you cast this spell. The held substance drains from its container into a magical sac in your body. While the spell lasts, you can deliver the substance with a mere touch. To do so to an opponent, you must make a successful melee touch attack. If you hit, the substance takes effect immediately, despite any onset period, and that opponent receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the substance. In the case of a personal infused extract, the opponent receives both a Fortitude save and spell resistance. If you miss, the substance remains in the magical sac for you to use later. This spell protects you from poison in the sac, but unless you have the poison use class feature, you suffer a 5%% chance of exposing yourself to the poison when you first cast the spell. If you roll a natural 1 while attempting to inject the poison into an enemy, you are exposed to it.
Twisted Space	CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:1 round	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.248	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/twistedSpace.html#_twisted-space	DESC:You distort the space around a creature, twisting the path of its melee attacks unpredictably, but always toward a nearby creature that the target threatens. Until the start of your next turn, melee attacks made by the target creature affect a random target instead of their intended target.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a length of wire bent into a circle)
Unerring Weapon	CLASSES:Inquisitor,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one weapon or 20 projectiles, all of which must be together at the time of casting	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.248	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/unerringWeapon.html#_unerring-weapon	DESC:This spell causes a weapon to veer closer to vital areas, improving the result of a critical threat. This transmutation grants a +2 bonus on attack rolls to confirm critical hits plus 1 additional bonus point per four caster levels (maximum total bonus +7). If the spell is cast on projectiles, the effect ends on a specific projectile whenever that projectile is used to make an attack, regardless of whether the attack hits. For this spell, shuriken are considered projectiles.
Viper Bomb Admixture	CLASSES:Alchemist=4	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SOURCEPAGE:p.248	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/viperBombAdmixture.html#_viper-bomb-admixture	DESC:Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract's duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw a bomb and hit a target directly, up to four vipers are released from the bomb. One viper attacks the target of the direct hit, and the other vipers attack up to three creatures that take damage from the splash damage. The vipers make melee touch attacks (using your base attack bonus + Intelligence modifier) and on a hit deal 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier damage, and the target is poisoned as if by a venomous snake (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 255). Hit or miss, the conjured vipers disappear after they make the attack. The conjured snakes are not damaged or adversely affected by the bombs you throw.
Walk through Space	CLASSES:Alchemist,Magus=6|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=7	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SOURCEPAGE:p.248	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/walkThroughSpace.html#_walk-through-space	DESC:When under the effects of this spell, you can teleport up to 30 feet as a move action. You must end this movement in an unoccupied space that you can stand on within line of sight. Alternatively, you can spend a move action to teleport to a standing position from lying prone. Teleporting does not provoke attacks of opportunity.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a wren's egg)
Warding Weapon	CLASSES:Magus=1|Sorcerer,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Abjuration	COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SOURCEPAGE:p.248	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/wardingWeapon.html#_warding-weapon	DESC:The focus of this spell flies upward above your head and takes a defensive position within your space. It lunges at opponents, as if guided by a martially trained hand, parrying and turning back melee attacks aimed at you, but does not strike back at any opponent nor does it damage them. The weapon serves only as a defense. While it protects you, you can cast spells without provoking attacks of opportunity, without the need to cast them defensively. A creature with the Disruptive feat (Core Rulebook 122) can easily bypass this spell's defenses. You provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells against these creatures even when subject to this spell, though you can still choose to cast defensively.	FACT:CompMaterial|(one melee weapon you are proficient in and you are holding)
Water Walk (Communal)	TYPE:Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Ranger=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Water	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	ITEM:Potion	TARGETAREA:creatures touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.249	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/waterWalk.html#_water-walk,-communal	DESC:This spell functions like water walk, except you divide the duration in 10-minute intervals among the creatures touched.
Weaken Powder	CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:1 loaded firearm	DURATION:instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.249	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/weakenPowder.html#_weaken-powder	DESC:Ammunition in the target firearm generates less of an explosive charge when fired. With such ammunition, the firearm's range increment is halved and the firer takes a -2 penalty on damage rolls. If aware of this spell's effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition.	FACT:CompMaterial|(an empty paper cartridge)
Wilderness Soldiers	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30ft.	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	SOURCEPAGE:p.249	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/wildernessSoldiers.html#_wilderness-soldiers	DESC:You call on the plants nearby to aid you in combat. This spell is ineffective if no plants you can direct are within the area. You can spend a swift action and/or a standard action on each of your turns to direct one of the following attacks. The attack bonus or CMB for these attacks equals your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier. You grant a +1 bonus per three caster levels (maximum +5) on damage rolls due to this spell. Your wilderness soldiers never provoke attacks of opportunity, and they do not count as allies for flanking or other purposes. Tree - A tree makes a melee attack with a 10-foot reach from its trunk. A hit deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 points + your Wisdom modifier. The tree can instead attempt a bull rush, drag, or reposition combat maneuver with the same reach, but the tree cannot move itself. Undergrowth or Hedgerow - Acting as a Medium creature, one square of undergrowth or hedgerow attempts a grapple combat maneuver against an opponent within or adjacent to that square. Heavy undergrowth gains a +2 bonus to its CMD. Undergrowth cannot move the grapple or pin a foe, but it can deal an amount of damage equal to 1d4 points + your Wisdom modifier by making a successful grapple check against a foe it is grappling. The undergrowth's CMD is 5 + its CMB. If you fail to direct the undergrowth to maintain the grapple, it releases its opponent.
Wreath of Blades	CLASSES:Magus=4|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Abjuration	COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	TARGETAREA:5-foot-radius emanation centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Reflex half (special, see below)	SPELLRES:No (special, see below)	SOURCEPAGE:p.249	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/wreathOfBlades.html#_wreath-of-blades	DESC:The daggers serving as focus of this spell take on a deadly sharpness as they animate and spin around you, creating a 5-foot-radius emanation of spinning mithral blades that moves with you. Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver. Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the warding weapon spell (see page 48). While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat (Core Rulebook 134) can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat. Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four +1 frost mithral daggers as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice. No matter the modifications made to the focus weapons, they must always be mithral daggers. No other type of weapons can serve as a focus for this spell.	FACT:CompMaterial|(four mithral daggers, each worth at least 502 gp each)

Masterwork Transformation.MOD	ITEM:Potion		DESC:You convert a non-masterwork item into its masterwork equivalent. A normal sword becomes a masterwork sword, a suit of leather armor becomes a masterwork suit of leather armor, a set of thieves' tools becomes masterwork thieves' tools, and so on. If the target object has no masterwork equivalent, the spell has no effect. You can affect 50 pieces of ammunition as if they were one weapon. You decide if the object's appearance changes to reflect this improved quality.<br>The material component for the spell is magical reagents worth the cost difference between a normal item and the equivalent masterwork item (typically 300 gp for a weapon, 150 gp for armor, or 50 gp for a tool). If an object has multiple masterwork options (such as a double weapon, or a spiked shield that could be made masterwork as a weapon or armor), you choose one option of the object to affect (though you can cast the spell again to affect another option).

###BLOCK: New Spells
# Spell Name	Classes of caster	School	Sub-School	Descriptor	Components	Casting Time	Range	Target Area or Effect	Duration	Save Info	Spell Resistance	Source Page	Description	FACT
Adhesive Blood	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bloodrager,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates (see text)	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:Your blood thickens to becomes a glue-like substance upon contact with air. A piercing or slashing weapon that deals hit point damage to you is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a Reflex save. A creature can pry off a stuck weapon on its turn as a standard action with a successful Strength check against the spell's DC. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive. The glue breaks down 5 rounds after you die, or when the duration ends. This glue has no effect while underwater or in environments that lack air.
Adhesive Spittle	CLASSES:Alchemist,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:15 Ft.	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds or until discharged [see text]	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:Once during this spell's duration, you can spit a viscous liquid as a standard action. This liquid functions as a tanglefoot bag, except you do not have to make a successful attack roll to hit your target. The DCs to counteract this adhesive (to avoid being stuck to the floor, to fly, to break the adhesive, or to cast a spell) use the spell's DC rather than a tanglefoot bag's normal DCs. The adhesive persists for 2d4 rounds after you spit it.
Adjustable Disguise	CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Bard,Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Glamer	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes [D]	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:This spell functions as disguise self, except as a swift action you can alter the disguise (within the limitations of disguise self). For example, you could make yourself look like a young human city guard, then an old elven wizard of the opposite gender, then a halfling thief, and so on. You can change the disguise a number of times equal to your caster level.
Adjustable Polymorph	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Magus,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:This spell functions as alter self, except you can as a swift action alter the disguise (within the limitations of alter self). For example, you could transform yourself into a halfling, then a lizardfolk, then an elf, and so on. You can change your form a number of times equal to your caster level.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a small piece of doppelganger flesh)
Aggressive Thundercloud	CLASSES:Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Electricity	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:5-ft.-diameter sphere	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:A crackling, spherical storm cloud flies in whichever direction you point and deals electricity damage to those it strikes. It has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. If it enters a space that contains a creature, the storm stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. It provides concealment (20%% miss chance) to anything within it, and its flickering light illuminates the same area a candle would. The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (as a move action for you); otherwise, it stays at rest and crackles with lightning. It can be moved by wind effects and counts as a Small creature for the purpose of determining how winds affect it. The sphere has no physical substance and cannot exert any force on corporeal creatures or objects. It disperses if it exceeds the spell's range.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a piece of a tree struck by lightning)
Aggressive Thundercloud (Greater)	CLASSES:Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Electricity|Sonic	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:5-ft.-diameter sphere	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates and Fortitude negates (see text)	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:This spell functions as aggressive thundercloud, except it deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to any creature it strikes. The first creature damaged by the cloud is also stunned for 1 round (Fortitude negates); this is a sonic effect.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a piece of a tree struck by lightning)
Air Geyser	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3|Shaman=4	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Air	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one creature or object up to Large size	DURATION:instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial (see text)	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:You create a powerful blast of air capable of flinging an opponent upward. If the target fails its Reflex save, the force of the air deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and hurls the target upward a number of feet equal to 5 x your caster level. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the target strikes the object in the same manner as it would during a normal fall. After this blast of air ceases, the target falls down (unless it was flying), taking falling damage as normal. A successful save means the target takes half damage from the air blast but is not moved by it.
Air Step	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Cleric,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Air	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:This spell functions as air walk, except you can rise no higher than 1 foot off the ground, you cannot pass over liquid, and the air you walk on is less stable than solid ground. When walking on air, you ignore difficult terrain that is less than 1 foot high, you do not trigger effects based on weight (such as a pressure plate), and any creature trying to track you through areas you crossed with this spell takes a -10 penalty on its Perception or Survival check to do so. However, because of the instability of the air you walk on, your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and you take a -4 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Ride checks. If you have 1 rank in Fly, your speed is not reduced when using this spell, and you can cross over liquid at half speed. If you have 5 ranks in Fly, you can cross liquid at full speed and do not take the penalties to your skill checks.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a goose feather)
Align Weapon (Communal)	CLASSES:Cleric,Inquisitor=3	SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:See Text	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:weapons or projectiles touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:This spell functions as align weapon, except you divide the duration in 1-minute increments between any number of touched weapons. Every group of up to 50 projectiles (which must be together at the time of casting) counts as one weapon for the purpose of dividing the spell's duration.
Alter Musical Instrument	CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Figment	COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one musical instrument	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (object)	SPELLRES:yes (object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:You alter an instrument so it sounds like a different kind of instrument you are familiar with. The change could be minor (such as making a lute sound like a guitar) or major (making a keyboard sound like drums). All other aspects of the instrument-such as volume, pitch, and how it is played- are unchanged. For example, a piccolo made to sound like an organ is no louder than a normal piccolo, can produce only high notes in the piccolo range, and is a wind instrument.	FACT:CompMaterial|(an instrument)
Anchored Step	CLASSES:Alchemist,Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes [D]	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:Powerful tendrils grow out of the bottom of your feet or footwear, partially anchoring you to the ground and making it more difficult for others to move you against your will. These tendrils dig into any surface, but leave no trace of your passing. You gain a +10 bonus to your CMD against bull rush, overrun, pull, push, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, as well as any other effect that would move you from your current position (such as being swallowed whole) or knock you prone. The tendrils slow your movement, however; your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet). This spell has no effect if you are moving without touching the ground (climbing, flying, swimming, and so on).	FACT:CompMaterial|(a bit of oak root)
Animal Purpose Training	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Inquisitor,Paladin,Ranger,Witch=1|Bard,Druid,Shaman=2	SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 minute	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one indifferent or friendly animal	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:You instill the target animal with a general purpose (see the Handle Animal skill), which can be any purpose except combat training-fighting, guarding, heavy labor, hunting, performance, or riding. This purpose supersedes the animal's previous trained purpose and any tricks it knows. When the spell ends, the animal reverts to its previous trained purpose and known tricks.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a swatch of black cloth)
Anonymous Interaction	CLASSES:Bard,Witch=2	SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:permanent [see text]	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.174	DESC:You cause the targets to forget all but the most general information about you. If they saw you or interacted with you, they still remember your presence and your general shape (such as humanoid), as well as the gist of your interactions with them (such as "She was asking about the queen"), but they don't remember specifically what you said, details of your appearance, or any identifying information about you. This spell targets any memories of you in the minute preceding its casting, but is otherwise permanent.
Anti-Incorporeal Shell	CLASSES:Cleric,Shaman,Witch=4	SCHOOL:Abjuration	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:10 Ft.	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.174	DESC:You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that incorporeal creatures cannot enter. This spell can be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.
Aura Sight	CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3|Inquisitor=4	SCHOOL:Divination	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SOURCEPAGE:p.174	DESC:This spell makes your eyes glow and allows you to see alignment auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect chaos/evil/good/law spell, but aura sight does not require concentration, and it discerns an aura's location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a creature's Hit Dice or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect evil spell. If an item or a creature bearing an aura is in line of sight, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to determine the aura's strength [one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a non-spell effect]. Aura sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 11th level or higher at a cost of 7,500 gp.
Banshee Blast	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=6	SCHOOL:Necromancy	DESCRIPTOR:Death|Fear|Mind-Affecting|Sonic	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 Ft.	TARGETAREA:Area cone-shaped burst	DURATION:instantaneous and (CASTERLEVEL) rounds [see text]	SAVEINFO:Reflex half and Will negates (see text)	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.174	DESC:You create a cone of spectral energy resembling screaming elven ghosts that deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4); a successful Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature that fails its Reflex save must succeed at a Will save or become panicked for 1 round/level.
Barrow Haze	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Necromancy	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.174	DESC:Barrow haze creates a bank of fog similar to that created by fog cloud, except that the vapors are black and they have a necromantic link to you. The vapors do not interfere with your vision. Because of your link to the haze, if any part of it is within 30 feet of you, any creatures within the haze count as in range for the purpose of using any of your hexes that have a maximum range of 30 feet. For example, suppose you have the slumber hex, you are 25 feet from one edge of the haze, and an opponent is 40 feet farther away at the other extreme of the cloud. You can use your slumber hex on that opponent even though it is actually 65 feet away from you.
Beastspeak	CLASSES:Druid,Shaman,Witch=2	SCHOOL:Divination	COMPS:S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes	SOURCEPAGE:p.175	DESC:When you're in the form of an animal (such as when you are using wild shape or are affected by a polymorph effect), you can speak normally, including when you cast spells with verbal components, and you sound like your normal self when you speak. You can cast this spell while in animal form, using animal-appropriate somatic components.
Bestow Auras	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Paladin=3	SCHOOL:Abjuration	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.175	DESC:You transfer one or more of your paladin or antipaladin auras (such as aura of courage and aura of resolve) to another creature. You retain the personal effect of that aura, but the target becomes the center of the aura effect instead of you. For example, if you transfer your aura of courage, you remain immune to fear, but the target becomes the center of the aura that grants a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects. If an aura functions only when you are conscious, the transferred aura functions only when the target is conscious. If an aura functions only when you expend uses of another ability (such as with aura of justice or aura of vengeance), the transferred aura functions only if the target has that other ability and expends uses of it to activate the aura. You cannot transfer an aura that affects only you (such as aura of good).
Blade Lash	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Magus=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:your melee weapon	DURATION:instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.175	DESC:Your weapon elongates and becomes whiplike. As part of casting this spell, you can use this weapon to attempt a trip combat maneuver against one creature within 20 feet, and you gain a +10 bonus on your roll, after which the weapon returns to its previous form.
Blazing Rainbow	CLASSES:Druid=6	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Light	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:0 Ft. or (CASTERLEVEL*10) ft.	TARGETAREA:bow or bridge of light	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until discharged [see text]	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.175	DESC:You create a spectrum of multicolored solid light that can be used for one of two effects. Bow: The spell creates a longbow or shortbow appropriate for your size, and you are proficient in the use of this weapon. When drawn, the bow automatically creates a +1 seeking brilliant energy arrow; it cannot fire any other arrows. A creature struck by one of these arrows is surrounded by faerie fire and dazzled for 1 minute. This version of the spell ends when you have fired a number of arrows equal to your caster level. Bridge: The light forms a bridge or ramp 5 feet wide and up to 10 feet long per caster level. Creatures on the bridge are dazzled. Allies gain a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) on checks, saves, and to their CMD to resist being moved from the bridge against their will. Enemies take a penalty equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) checks, saves, and to their CMD to resist being moved from the bridge against their will.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a drop of rainwater)
Blessed Fist	CLASSES:Cleric,Paladin=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Good	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:creature touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.175	DESC:The target is considered to be armed even when unarmed, so it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when it attacks foes with unarmed strikes. Its unarmed strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage (target's choice). If the target already has this ability (such as from the monk unarmed strike ability or the Improved Unarmed Strike feat), its unarmed strikes gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, and they count as good-aligned weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
Bloatbomb	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Necromancy	DESCRIPTOR:Acid|Death	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:living creature touched	DURATION:instantaneous and (CASTERLEVEL) minutes [see text]	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates or Reflex half (see text);	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.175	DESC:The target creature dies if it fails a Fortitude saving throw and its Hit Dice are no more than half your caster level. If it dies, its corpse rapidly putrefies. The next creature to touch the corpse within 1 minute per level of the target's death causes the corpse to explode in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 3d6 points of acid damage (Reflex half).
Blood Armor	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bloodrager,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SOURCEPAGE:p.176	DESC:Your blood becomes as hard as iron upon contact with air. Each time you take at least 5 points of piercing or slashing damage, your armor gains a +1 enhancement bonus to your AC. An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell. This enhancement bonus stacks with itself, but not with an existing enhancement bonus, to a maximum enhancement bonus of +5. This spell has no effect while underwater or in environments that lack air.
Blood Sentinel	CLASSES:Alchemist,Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:one animal sculpture	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.176	DESC:After casting this spell, you pour a few drops of your blood and saliva into the mouth of the animal sculpture material component, temporarily giving it life. The animal is bonded to you as if it were a familiar, and it has the abilities of a familiar (use your caster level as your effective wizard level to determine its abilities), but it does not grant you the Alertness feat or the special ability of its animal type. If your blood sentinel is slain, you take 2 points of Intelligence drain and the blood sentinel's body becomes a destroyed statue. This spell has no effect if you already have a familiar or another blood sentinel.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a life-sized animal sculpture of a familiar made of clay, cloth, stone, or wood, plus mandrake root worth 25 gp)
Blurred Movement	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Bloodrager,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Glamer	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SOURCEPAGE:p.176	DESC:This spell functions as blur, except that the blurring occurs only when you move at least 10 feet on your turn and ceases at the end of your movement. It is therefore mainly used to protect against attacks on your turn, such as attacks of opportunity. If you move at least twice your speed on your turn, the blurring lasts until the start of your next turn.
Body Capacitance	CLASSES:Alchemist,Sorcerer,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Electricity	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until discharged [see text]	SOURCEPAGE:p.176	DESC:If you take electricity damage while this spell is active, some of the energy is stored on your skin, as with holding the charge on a touch spell. You can release this stored electricity by making a melee touch attack. You gain a +3 bonus on the attack roll if your opponent is wearing metal armor, is carrying a metal weapon, or is made of metal. The target of your touch attack is dealt electricity damage equal to half the amount of electricity damage you took after you cast this spell (for example, if you saved for half damage against a lightning bolt and took only 15 points of electricity damage, your next touch attack deals 7 points of electricity damage). This spell is discharged once you hit with a melee touch attack to deliver its damage. If you take electricity damage multiple times while this spell is active, use the largest amount of electricity damage you took to determine your touch attack damage.	FACT:CompMaterial|(an iron coil)
Bullet Ward	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Inquisitor,Paladin,Ranger,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Abjuration	COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes or until discharged	SOURCEPAGE:p.176	DESC:You toss several adamantine bullets into the air, which then hover protectively nearby and intercept firearm attacks targeting you. The number of bullets protecting you is equal to half your caster level (maximum 4). When an opponent takes a shot at you with a firearm, as an immediate action you can designate a hovering bullet to attempt to block the attack, increasing your AC against that attack by 10. Doing this destroys the adamantine bullet whether or not the attack hits. The spell is discharged when all affected adamantine bullets are destroyed or taken from you. Each adamantine bullet has AC 24, 20 hit points, and hardness 20.	FACT:CompMaterial|(one to four adamantine bullets, each worth 61 gp)
Buoyancy	CLASSES:Bard,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) Medium or smaller objects or creatures no two of which can be more than 20 ft. apart	DURATION:up to (CASTERLEVEL) rounds [see text]	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:yes (object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.177	DESC:The affected targets become incredibly buoyant, floating naturally on any water at least 1 foot deep. An affected creature that deliberately tries to submerge must succeed at a DC 20 Swim check every round to stay underwater. If a target spends at least 1 round on dry land, the spell ends for that creature only.
Chameleon Stride (Greater)	CLASSES:Ranger=3	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Glamer	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:5 Ft.	TARGETAREA:allies in a 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [see text]	SOURCEPAGE:p.177	DESC:This spell functions as chameleon stride (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 210), except it confers its bonuses upon all allies within 10 feet of you at the time the spell is cast. Those affected by this spell are able to see each other and themselves as if they were unaffected by the spell. If an affected creature moves out of the area, it loses the benefit of the spell. Creatures that move into the area after the spell is cast do not gain its benefit.
Climbing Beanstalk	CLASSES:Druid,Witch=2	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:5-ft. square of climbable beanstalks	DURATION:instantaneous	SOURCEPAGE:p.177	DESC:You cause a thick, sturdy beanstalk to sprout from the ground and grow upward to a height of 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels. The growing stalk anchors itself to sturdy objects such as walls or ceilings, and grows around objects that do not fully obstruct its square (such as tree branches), but is stopped by solid obstacles. The beanstalk provides numerous hand- and footholds; its climb DC 5. The beanstalk can support up to 200 pounds plus 50 pounds per caster level, or double that amount if anchored on its upper end. If it anchors itself to a sturdy mobile object (such as a ship or a siege engine), breaking the object free requires a DC 23 Strength check or cutting through the beanstalk (hardness 2, 40 hp). If the ground is capable of supporting plant life, the beanstalk continues to live as a normal plant, and it produces nutritious (if unappetizing) beans. Otherwise, the plant dies after 1d6 hours; its husk remains as durable as a small tree.
Companion Life Link	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Necromancy	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:one of your animal companions or your familiar	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [see below]	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.177	DESC:You create a life link between yourself and the target. You sense whenever the target is wounded and are made immediately aware if the target is slain. If you are wounded or slain, the target is made aware. As a free action, you can call out to the target, causing it to return to you (if able and willing); this ends the spell.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a drop of eidolon ichor)
Contingent Action	CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Evocation	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 minute	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one willing creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D] or until discharged	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.178	DESC:The target gains an extra action that becomes available when a condition which you dictate is met. At the time of casting, you dictate the condition, and the target specifies a readied action that occurs when triggered by this condition. The condition needed to trigger the readied action must be clear, although it can be general. If a complicated or convoluted condition is prescribed, the whole combination might fail when triggered. For example, suppose the trigger and the action are stated as "If the target is attacked while he is not holding a weapon, he draws a weapon." If the target has no weapon to draw when the trigger occurs, the action fails. If the trigger and the action are "If an ally within 20 feet falls unconscious, the target moves to a space adjacent to that ally" but the target is chained to a wall when the trigger occurs and can't reach the unconscious ally, the action fails. The readied action must be a standard, move, or swift action-it cannot be used to cast a spell or use a supernatural ability. This action counts as a readied action and doesn't count toward the number of actions the creature can take in a round. When the condition occurs, the target can decide not to use the readied action. Once the condition is triggered, the spell is discharged-whether or not the target uses the readied action or the action is successful. This spell counts as a contingency spell for the purpose of having multiple contingent effects on a creature at the same time.
Contingent Scroll	CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Evocation	COMPS:V, S, M, F	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL * 10) minutes [D] or until discharged	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.178	DESC:You transfer the power of a scroll to the target so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate. Casting this spell destroys the scroll, but allows the spell in it to be triggered in a manner similar to the contingency spell. The spell on the scroll must be a spell on your spell list, it must affect the target of this spell (the target of this spell is considered the caster of the scroll), and its level must be no higher than onefourth your caster level (maximum 5th level). The writing on the scroll appears on the target's skin in any location you desire; this writing does not harm or interfere with the target in any way, and doesn't need to be on exposed skin to function. For example, you could make the writing appear on under a target's clothing. The writing on the target's skin can be deciphered and identified as if it were the scroll it was copied from. Damaging the target has no effect on the stored spell, but effects such as erase that target magical writing can affect it. The condition needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although it can be general. In all cases, this spell immediately brings into effect the scroll's spell, the latter being effectively cast instantaneously when the trigger occurs. If a complicated or convoluted condition is prescribed, the whole spell combination (the contingent scroll and the scroll's spell) might fail when triggered. The scroll's spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to at that moment. This spell counts as a contingency spell for the purpose of having multiple contingent effects on a creature at the same time.

Creeping Ice	CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Cold	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:anchored plane of ice, up to (CASTERLEVEL) 10-ft. squares	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates (see text)	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.178	DESC:This spell covers the floor, the ground, or some other calm horizontal surface (such as a placid lake or a gentle river) with a sheet of slowly growing ice. The initial sheet of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ice is hard, strong, and opaque, and is 1 inch thick per caster level. The ice is strong enough to support the weight of a typical horse, making it possible for creatures to cross a body of water. Each 10-foot square of ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the ice automatically. A section of ice whose hit points drop to 0 is destroyed, leaving an area of ice chunks, slush, and snow that counts as difficult terrain. If a creature tries to break through the ice with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + your caster level. Each round on your turn, the sheet of ice grows 1 foot in all directions except toward you. This growth is slow enough that any creature in the area has time to move out of the way or step onto the ice. If the growing ice completely covers a creature's square, the creature must choose whether it moves onto the sheet of ice, is knocked prone on the sheet of ice, or is bull rushed into an adjacent square.

You can choose for the writing to be visible or invisible, and it doesn't harm the material upon which it is placed. A detect magic spell causes an invisible mark to glow and be visible. If any creature other than you touches the warded object or area and fails a Fortitude save, its skin turns bright red for 1 hour per level. This coloring cannot be washed away, but it can be dispelled. See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The ward cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.

When the curse is triggered, the creature bursts into flame, taking 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 8d6). Furthermore, it catches on fire, taking 2d6 points of fire damage per round at the end of its turn each round until the creature dies or is quenched as normal.  (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444).

You learn about one relative per round you concentrate on the target. For example, you might learn that the target's father's name is Jarn, the father lives on a nearby farm, and the target and his father don't get along. Since this spell reads the target's mind, you can learn only what the target knows or believes.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a copper piece)

For example, you could make a Small greatsword look like a Small quarterstaff, a Medium club, or a Large dagger. Even the appearance of an improvised weapon is possible. The extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or make the item look like it is composed of different materials (stone, wood, adamantine, and so on). The spell does not provide any of the abilities of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile or audible properties of the item or how it is wielded. A creature that interacts with the glamer may attempt a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.

Furthermore, you can choose to act as if you had failed your saving throw. If you do so, you gain a +20 bonus on Bluff checks to convince others that you failed your save and are under the enchantment's effects. A creature that attempts to use magic to detect this ruse or to make you speak truthfully about it must succeed at a caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level) to do so.

The entry point looks like a circle of toadstools enclosing a 10-foot square. Only those you designate can enter the meadow before you do, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You can open it again from your own side at will. Once a visitor has passed through the entry point, they find themselves in an idyllic twilight meadow surrounded by an impassable grove of fruit and nut trees. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. You can configure the meadow into any shape you desire, to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is comfortable and temperate. The trees can provide enough food to sustain 4 people per caster level for a day. A staff of near-transparent animal or feylike servants (as many as two per caster level) wait upon all who enter. The servants function as unseen servant spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the meadow. Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the meadow, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

After the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time.

Any creature that fails its save against the sphere catches on fire (see page 444 of the Core Rulebook). If a creature catches on fire, the DC to extinguish the flames is equal to the DC of this spell.

If the rage power granted by this spell has a use limitation (such as once per rage or a number of times per day), any uses of that rage power count toward that limit (including for later castings of this spell). If you swap out a rage power that is required to qualify for another one of your rage powers, you cannot use any rage powers dependent on the one you swapped out until the spell ends. For example, if you have the intimidating glare and terrifying howl rage powers and you swap out intimidating glare for surprise accuracy, you cannot use terrifying howl until the spell ends.

Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must attempt a Reflex save. Those who fail become entangled, but can break free by succeeding at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The area of the spell is considered difficult terrain. A creature moving through the glue must succeed at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as part of its move action (DC = the spell's DC). Creatures that fail lose their movement and become entangled in the first square they enter. The spell can also be used to create a sticky coating on an item. A creature holding a targeted item can attempt a Reflex saving throw against the spell's DC. If the initial saving throw succeeds, the item is unaffected. If it fails, the item is stuck in place. If an affected item is connected to another item (such as a sword in a sheath or a cork in a potion bottle), it cannot be separated from the other item unless the creature succeeds at a combat maneuver check or a Strength check as a move action to free it (DC = the spell's DC). A creature must succeed at saving throw each time it attempts to use the sticky item; otherwise, the item becomes stuck to the creature. Sticky armor or clothing imposes a -10 circumstance penalty on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple attempted by the wearer, as well as to the wearer's CMD to avoid being grappled.

If the hex has a target, it targets the intruder. If the hex has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. The triggered hex uses this spell's caster level and DC. Read magic allows its caster to identify a hex glyph with a successful DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and indicates that it stores a hex, but does not indicate the effect of that hex.

For example, normally after you target a creature with a charm hex, you cannot target it again for 1 day. But after casting this spell on a creature, you could try the charm hex repeatedly as long as the spell persists. The end of this spell has no effect on any active or ongoing hex on a creature. For example, if the creature failed its save against a second use of your charm hex, it remains charmed for the normal duration, even if the spell expires before the hex does. Each subsequent casting of this spell on a target within a 24-hour period gives the target a +4 bonus on its save against the spell and imposes a -4 penalty on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance with this spell.

If any target is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, that target automatically triggers the power of the pact. The triggering target drains 1 hit point from all other targets who have at least 1 hit point and are within 30 feet of the triggering target; these hit points are applied to the triggering target as magical healing. This healing can prevent the triggering creature from dying, if the attack would cause the target's to have an amount of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score. This healing cannot raise the triggering creature above 1 hit point; any excess hit points drained from other targets are wasted. The pact can be triggered once per round.

It does not affect movement modes you do not actually have-for example, if you do not have a swim speed, this spell does not grant you a swim speed.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a pinch of dirt)

The sound grows in strength as time passes. On your turn in the round after you cast the spell, the chime deals 1d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures and objects within 5 feet of the target. Each round after that, the damage increases by 1d6 and reaches 5 feet farther in all directions. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage for that round only.

You take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells you cast. Any creature affected by a rage effect (barbarian's rage, bloodrager's bloodrage, blood rage monster ability, rage spell, skald's inspired rage raging song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt at a Will saving throw, without the rage effect's bonus to Will; failure means the rage effect ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate). If you become affected by a rage effect while this spell is active, this spell immediately ends. If your rage effect comes from a skald's raging song, then it ends only for you, and you cannot re-accept the effects of the song.

This movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. You can concentrate on this spell and hustle at the same time.

The target's alignment must be opposite yours on at least one alignment axis-if you are neutral with no other alignment components, the target must have an alignment with no neutral component. Any creature that sees the target can attempt a DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check to discern the target's alignment, even if the mark is covered. You are aware of the direction and distance to the target as long as it remains within 100 miles of you and on the same plane.

The target can visualize this page as easily as looking at it in person, including minute details visible to close scrutiny by the naked eye. The memory of the page includes text and images, such as a drawing or a map. Someone unfamiliar with the language on the page (or even an illiterate person) could relay what is written simply by copying the shapes of the letters so another person can read them. The maximum number of pages that a particular target can memorize through repeated castings of this spell is equal to the target's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); any attempts beyond this limit have no effect, although the target's memory of a page could be erased (using modify memory or a similar effect) to effectively make room for a different one. A creature that memorizes magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) cannot borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. However, this would allow a wizard to copy a spell into his spellbook so he could prepare the spell from his book (assuming the spell takes up only one page in a spellbook).

The creature is aware of the message and who the recipient is. Any attempt to speak, write, or otherwise communicate the message to anyone other than its intended recipient causes the target to forget the message for 1d6 minutes. Attempts to read the target's mind (such as with detect thoughts) or to force the target to reveal the message (such as with torture or magical compulsion) likewise cause temporary amnesia regarding the message. The target can communicate the message only to someone it believes is the intended recipient, which means that disguises, illusions, and polymorph effects might fool the target into delivering the message. Once the target communicates the message, the message is permanently erased from the target's memory.

The space can hold as many as eight Medium creatures. Creatures that enter this space are hidden and beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. If the mirror is covered (such as by a cloth, or by being placed face down or against a wall), the portal becomes inactive. If the mirror is broken or moved more than 5 feet from where it was when you cast the spell, the spell ends; any creatures within the extradimensional space are expelled from it (see below) and become nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the space can see and hear through it as if looking through an open window the same size as the mirror. Creatures outside the extradimensional space see only what is normally reflected in the mirror. Any creature in the space can make itself visible in the reflection of the mirror for 1 round at a time, however creatures outside the space cannot hear any sounds that originate inside. Anything inside the extradimensional space is expelled when the spell ends (even if the mirror is covered). Only one creature at a time can enter the mirror, and creatures can enter only if they can fit through an opening the same size as the mirror. For example, a hand mirror isn't big enough for a Small or larger creature to use it as a portal. Objects can enter the extradimensional space only if brought by a creature able to fully pass through the mirror.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a glass or metal marble and a twisted loop of parchment)

This does not prevent the item from later damage or corrosion that would ruin the mirrored surface. The spell can be cast only on a metal item with a fairly smooth and contiguous surface, such as a breastplate, a helm, a shield, or a sword, but not a mace, chainmail, or scale mail.

A direct hit deals 2d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of where the ball hits takes 1d6 points of fire damage from the splash (Reflex half). Each of these creatures takes an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on its turn for the next 1d3 rounds, unless it is cooled off (with water, snow, or any effect that deals 5 or more points of cold damage).

The vapors do not obscure sight, but it nauseates creatures as stinking cloud. The target is immune to these vapors. These vapors persist as the creature moves, filling every square it passes through until it has filled a number of squares equal to 4 times your caster level-if you move through more squares than that, the squares over that amount at not filled with the vapors. Each creature that enters or ends its turn in the area filled with these vapors must succeed at a Fortitude save or become nauseated as long as it remains in the square and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves.

Against outsiders with that alignment component or subtype, your allies in the area gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance, and their spells ignore the first 10 points of energy resistance (but not energy immunity). This spell gains the alignment descriptor that is opposite the outsider alignment chosen. For example, if you choose for the spell to affect evil outsiders, then this spell has the good descriptor.

The creature gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. As an immediate action when your companion takes damage, you can take that damage yourself to prevent your companion from being harmed (similar to shield other, except the damage is not split between you and the target). Forms of harm that do not involve the loss of hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level drain, and death effects, are not affected. If the creature suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, you cannot take that damage on behalf of your companion creature because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, damage directed to you by the spell is not reassigned to the subject. If you and your companion move out of range of each other, the spell ends.

The mud acts as a slow spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the slow effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as create water or hydraulic push) removes all the mud in 1 round. A haste effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the haste. Slow does not stack with the effects of slowing mud.

The spell's range must reach any square within 10 feet of the haunt's area. You must be aware of the haunt prior to casting the spell, and casting the spell does not trigger the haunt. You can ask one question per 2 caster levels. The haunt's knowledge is limited to what its original creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke. A haunt often remembers the circumstance that led to its existence (though this recollection might be from the original victim's perspective and therefore not objective), what triggers it, and how it can be laid to rest (destroyed). Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the haunt is angry and vindictive. If the haunt's alignment is more than one step away from yours, the haunt can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. A haunt's Will save modifier is equal to 3 + the haunt's CR. If the save is successful, the haunt can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you (using Bluff). A haunt's Bluff modifier equals its CR (minimum +0) or might be determined by the GM based upon the original victim. The haunt can speak only about what it knew in life and the circumstances by which it became a haunt. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after it was created. A neutral or good haunt might cooperate with similarly aligned creatures in order to end its suffering. If a haunt has been subject to this spell within the past week, a new casting of this spell on it fails. You can cast this on a haunt that has been deceased for any amount of time. Unlike a corpse affected by speak with dead, a haunt wants to express itself, if only to share its pain or to cause mischief.

Spellcrash (Lesser)	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Abjuration	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Will negates (see text)	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.194	DESC:You create a discordant blast of energy that disrupts the target's available magic. If the target prepares spells, it must choose one of its prepared 3rd-level spells, which is immediately lost; if the target has no 3rd-level spells prepared, it must lose a 2ndlevel spell it has prepared (progressing down to 1st-level spell if it has no 2nd-level spells prepared) each round at the start of its turn. If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, it loses one of its available 3rd-level spell slots; if the target has no available 3rd-level spell slots, it must lose a 2nd-level spell slot (progressing down to 1st-level spell if it has no 2ndlevel spell slots available). If the target has more than one spellcasting class, choose one at random to be affected. This spell has no effect on spell-like abilities. Any spell or spell slot lost because of this spell is treated as if the caster had failed a concentration check while trying to cast it-the spell or spell slot is wasted and has no effect, but is recovered normally the next time the character prepares spells or regains spell slots. There is no initial saving trow for this spell, but the taget can attampt a Will saving throw each round at the end of its turn.
Stench of Prey	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Shaman=3	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:one creature [see text]	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (see text)	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.194	DESC:The target exudes a strong odor that most predators recognize as the scent of helpless prey. The closest 1d4+1 predatory creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save or start attacking the target (animals with the scent ability are affected if within 60 feet). If the predator is an animal, it can be called away from the target by a handler using the "down" trick (Core Rulebook 97) or any effect that suspends or dispels emotion or rage effects. This spell has no effect on constructs, undead, or creatures with the unnatural aura ability or effects that repel animals.
Stone Discus	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one or more stone discuses	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.194	DESC:You create a stone discus, which flies at an enemy. You can create one discus, plus one additional discus at 7th and 11th caster levels. For each discus you create, you decide whether its edge is blunt (and deals bludgeoning damage) or sharp (and deals slashing damage). Each discus requires a ranged attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of damage. The discuses can be launched at more than one target, but all must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and launched simultaneously. At caster level 5th, the discuses count as magic and silver. At caster level 10th, they also count as cold iron. At caster level 15th, they also count as adamantine.

Stricken Heart	CLASSES:Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2|Shaman=3	SCHOOL:Necromancy	DESCRIPTOR:Death	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:creature touched	DURATION:instantaneous	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.194	DESC:This spell covers your hand with a writhing black aura. As part of casting the spell, you can make a melee touch attack that deals 2d6 points of negative energy damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute instead. Creatures immune to precision damage are immune to the staggered effect.
Stunning Barrier	CLASSES:Cleric,Inquisitor,Paladin,Sorcerer,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Abjuration	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds or until discharged	SAVEINFO:none and Will negates (see text)	SPELLRES:no and yes (see text)	SOURCEPAGE:p.194	DESC:You are closely surrounded by a barely visible magical field.

Once the field has stunned an opponent, the spell is discharged.

The next time a creature succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver against the target, the attacker's weapon takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). If the attacker used a natural weapon for the sunder, the attacker takes half this damage. Spell resistance applies to this damage. The attacker can attempt a Fortitude save to halve this damage. The ward on the target counts as a magical trap and can be detected and disabled as such.
Sundering Shards	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:melee weapon touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or until discharged	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates (see text)	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.195	DESC:You channel power into a melee weapon. If the weapon's wielder destroys an item with a successful sunder combat maneuver, she can release the extra power in the weapon, shattering the sundered item into jagged shards that deal 1d6 points of piercing and slashing damage to the creature that was wearing, carrying, or wielding the now-shattered item. Any creature (other than the wielder of the weapon targeted by this spell) adjacent to that creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 1d6 points of piercing and slashing damage from flying shards. The shards also count as whatever special materials the sundered item was made of (for example, the shards from a shattered cold iron weapon are cold iron). Once the weapon's extra power is unleashed, the spell is discharged.

Unlike symbol of death, symbol of laughter has no hit point limit; once it is triggered, a symbol of laughter remains active for 1 minute per caster level. Symbol of laughter can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 10th level or higher at a cost of 5,000 gp.	FACT:CompMaterial|(mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)
Thorn Javelin	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Shaman=1	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Poison	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:0 Ft.	TARGETAREA:javelin-like thorn	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.196	DESC:A wooden thorn the size of a javelin (appropriate for your size) appears in your open hand. You can wield this thorn as a javelin, and you are proficient in its use. Any creature struck by the javelin must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. If you throw the javelin, another one appears in your hand. Any javelin that leaves your grasp disappears at the end of your turn. Each javelin attack you make reduces the spell's remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after that attack resolves.
Thorny Entanglement	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Shaman,Witch=3	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long	TARGETAREA:Plants in a 40-ft.-radius spread	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial (see text)	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.196	DESC:This spell functions as entangle, except the plants also grow thorns and can fling them up to 15 feet. Any creature that moves within 15 feet of the spell's area is attacked once on its turn by the animated plants. The plants use your caster level as their base attack bonus and add your spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for witches; Wisdom for druids, rangers, and shamans) to the attack roll. A volley of thorns counts as a thrown weapon and deals 2d6 points of piercing damage on a successful hit. A creature that enters the spell's area or ends its turn there automatically takes 2d6 points of piercing damage.
Thunderstomp	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Druid,Magus,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:instantaneous	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.196	DESC:You stomp your foot or strike your weapon against the ground or floor, creating a ripple of power that you can use to trip a creature. Attempt the combat maneuver check to trip the target, but instead of your base attack bonus you can use your caster level, and instead of your Strength modifier you can use your spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for magi and wizards; Wisdom for druids and rangers; Charisma for bloodragers and sorcerers). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This spell has no effect if you cannot reach the ground or floor, or if your target is not in contact with the ground or floor.
Thunderstomp (Greater)	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Druid,Magus,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:60 Ft.	TARGETAREA:60-ft. line	DURATION:instantaneous	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.196	DESC:This spell functions as thunderstomp, except as noted. It allows you target multiple creatures with this spell, including creatures more than one size category larger than you. When you attempt the combat maneuver check, apply its result to each creature within the area, regardless of size.
Time Shudder	CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 Ft.	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	DURATION:1 round	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.196	DESC:You cause a ripple in time that affects all creatures in the area.

Triggered Suggestion	CLASSES:Bard=3|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Language-Dependent|Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days or until completed	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.197	DESC:This spell functions as suggestion, except you can use it only to specify a condition that triggers a special activity, and the subject does not remember that you made the suggestion. For example, you could use triggered suggestion on a palace guard to make him attack the king the next time he and the king are alone, and the guard would not remember the suggestion to do so until the trigger occurred.
Twilight Haze	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Shadow	DESCRIPTOR:Darkness|Shadow	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:fog spreads in 20-ft. radius	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.197	DESC:You create a gray haze that obscures sight (as fog cloud) and causes the illumination level within it to drop one step (as darkness). Since this spell produces an illusion rather than a true physical fog, it is unaffected by wind and can be cast underwater.
Unbearable Brightness	CLASSES:Alchemist,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Light	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal and 30 ft. [see text]	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:none and Reflex partial (see text)	SPELLRES:no and yes (see text)	SOURCEPAGE:p.197	DESC:Your body glows with a terrible light. Creatures within 30 feet of you that can see you are dazzled (no saving throw). Creatures with light sensitivity must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be blinded. This light counts as daylight for the purpose of affecting darkness effects (and vice versa). If the emanation enters an area under the effect of magical darkness (or vice versa), both effects are temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Dazzled and blinded conditions from your light end when the spell ends or when the creature is out of line of sight.
Unholy Ice Weapon	CLASSES:Cleric,Inquisitor=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Cold|Evil|Water	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:0 Ft.	TARGETAREA:one ice weapon	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.198	DESC:This spell functions as holy ice weapon, except the weapon is made of frozen unholy water, and instead deals additional damage to creatures that are susceptible to unholy water.

Each affected creature gains a +2 profane bonus to Strength and Charisma, a +1 profane bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. The effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian's rage.
Vampiric Shadow Shield	CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Necromancy	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]	SOURCEPAGE:p.198	DESC:This spell wreathes you in shadowy energy and damages those that make melee attacks against you. Any creature that strikes you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage. When an attacker takes damage from the spell, you heal a number of hit points equal to 25%% of the damage the spell dealt.
Wall of Blindness/Deafness	CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4|Cleric=5	SCHOOL:Necromancy	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:translucent wall (CASTERLEVEL*20) ft. long or a translucent ring with a radius of up to (CASTERLEVEL/2*5) ft.; either form 20 ft. high	DURATION:concentration + (CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.198	DESC:You create a translucent wall of energy, within which can be seen indistinct images of faces with their eyes or ears sewn shut. When you create the wall, decide whether it blinds or deafens. Any creature that passes through the wall must save or become permanently blinded or deafened [as blindness/deafness]. The wall must be vertical and either rectangular or a ring. It need not touch the ground. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature when it is cast, the spell fails.
Wall of Nausea	CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Pattern	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:transparent wall whose area is up to (CASTERLEVEL) 10-ft. squares	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:see text	SPELLRES:no	SOURCEPAGE:p.199	DESC:You create a transparent, shimmering wall through which creatures and objects appear to be wildly distorted to viewers. Any creature that passes through the wall is immediately assailed by overwhelming vertigo, becoming nauseated for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save; if nauseated, the creature must also succeed at a DC 12 Acrobatics check or fall prone. Creatures gain partial concealment (20%% miss chance) against creatures on the other side of the wall. The wall must be vertical and rectangular. It need not touch the ground. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature when it is cast, the spell fails.
Wave Shield	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Druid,Magus,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Abjuration	DESCRIPTOR:Water	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:1 round or until discharged	SOURCEPAGE:p.199	DESC:You create a rushing torrent of water in the rough outline of a shield. The water protects you from one physical or fire attack, granting you DR/- and fire resistance equal to half your caster level (minimum 1) on that attack. Once the spell has reduced the damage of one attack against you, it is discharged.
Whip of Ants	CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=6	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:0 Ft.	TARGETAREA:whiplike swarm	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D [see text]]	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.199	DESC:This spell functions as whip of spiders, except it summons army ants, and any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by an army ant swarm (3d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction, Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 16). If you transform the whip into an army ant swarm, it has 16 hit points.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a square of red cloth)
Whip of Centipedes	CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:0 Ft.	TARGETAREA:whiplike swarm	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D [see text]]	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.199	DESC:This spell functions as whip of spiders, except it summons centipedes, and any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a centipede swarm (2d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction, Bestiary 43). If you transform the whip into a centipede swarm, it has 10 hit points.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a square of red cloth)
Whip of Spiders	CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:0 Ft.	TARGETAREA:whiplike swarm	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D [see text]]	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.199	DESC:You summon hundreds of Diminutive spiders, which cling together in the form of a whip made for a creature of your size. You can wield this object as if it were an actual whip, except you make a melee touch attack with it instead of a regular attack. Any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a spider swarm (1d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction, Bestiary 258). The swarm whip is able to damage creatures with armor or natural armor, even if a normal whip could not. It cannot be used to make bull rush, grapple, or trip attacks, and (unlike a swarm) is subject to a miss chance for concealment and cover. The whip is immune to all weapon damage, is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage, and is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate). The whip takes half again as much damage from spells or effects that affect an area, but since it is considered part of your gear, it takes damage only if you fail a saving throw on a 1 or if it is specifically targeted by an opponent. The whip does not have a swarm's susceptibility to high winds. As a standard action, you can transform the whip into a spider swarm (all squares of the swarm must be within 15 feet of you); thereafter it functions as summon swarm. The spider swarm has 3 hit points and persists in that form for 2 rounds or until the end of this spell's duration, whichever comes first.	FACT:CompMaterial|(a square of red cloth)
Widen Auras	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Paladin=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SOURCEPAGE:p.199	DESC:The range of your antipaladin or paladin auras doubles.

Summon Nature's Ally I	KEY:Naturalist Summon Nature's Ally I	TYPE:Arcane	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One summoned creature	DURATION:(ConjurationNaturalistsCharmBonus+(CASTERLEVEL)) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	SOURCEPAGE:p.350	DESC:This spell summons an animal, magical beast, or vermin.	DESC:This spell summons an extraplanar creature [typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane]. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10-5. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell. A summoned Nature's Ally cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components [such as wish]. When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10-5 marked with an "*" are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an "*" always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment. [Table Not Included]
